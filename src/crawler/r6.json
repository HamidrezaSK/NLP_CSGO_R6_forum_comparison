{"r6": "Originally posted by Kestrel Hudson:If I understand it correctly, it dynamically puts an FPS cap, that would make your GPU avoid reaching a load of 100%, as this state increases the latency.If you want a detailed explanation:https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QzmoLJwS6eQ it's not very correct AFAIK.Here is a simplified explanation: Reducing latency with Nvidia ReflexIn GPU-intensive scenarios (such as video games) the CPU (processor) queues up work for the GPU in a so called 'render queue' so that the GPU (graphics card) always has something to do. This maximizes framerate but it also increases latency since frames have to 'wait in line' to be rendered. Nvidia's Reflex SDK dynamically reduces the render queue by keeping the CPU in perfect sync with the GPU. This also reduces pressure on the CPU so that games can sample a mouse input at the last possible moment.In short: Reflex's low latency mode reduces the work that your CPU has to do by making it work together with your GPU more efficiently, thus reducing the amount of 'backlog' your GPU has and as such reducing the overall system latency. As an added benefit, the reduced stress on the CPU allows mouse inputs to be 'recorded' at the last possible moment, thus further decreasing latency and increasing responsiveness.

Casual doesnt teach anything half the time so unranked is very useful to learn the flow of the game and basic common strats to attack and defend.

{"r6": "I've known of this game for years, and throughout the time I've heard a lot of mixed reception for the game. \nI started playing two days ago, allowing myself a fair amount of time to get a fair judgement. And honestly I disagree with 90% of the negative things that have ever been said about the game. \nOne of the things that stands out to me the most is the performance - pretty much stable 144 fps at all times. This game absolutely respects my near top-end rig while looking great. \nThe tactical teamwork aspect is a joy to play. Sam Fisher feels like second nature to me since I've been playing Splinter Cell since I was in single digit age. Peeking corners and getting the first shot feels visceral and exciting, and holding a corner doesn't feel static or boring because there's so many things that can go wrong *and* right.\nThat's my opinion. I really, really enjoy this game. I really can't think of anything that makes me go \"ugh this sucks, I don't want to play anymore\" aside from ONE time when I was Mavericking a Castle-reinforced door and it suddenly just popped open in my face. I got shot at obviously but escaped and won. It was definitely a \"wtf\" moment.\nOn top of everything else, Ubi has been really *really* supportive. I feel like their community really gives them too much \u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665 sometimes. Again, I've been playing this company's games since I was in single digit age, and over time they've only gotten better and better at being responsive and supportive to their community. \nThey can improve of course, but so can all people and all communities who dedicate themselves to projects. Everything can improve. So please don't misinterpret this as a \"game is perfect, ubi is perfect\" type of thing. It's important as a principle to give credit where credit is due, and I think this game and Ubi as a company (and as individuals too) deserve some credit."},

Vigil is currently the best roamer in the game. Ok lets compare Vigil and Montagne. Vigil provides next to no utility in terms of secondary gadget - impacts help him roam, but if the team rush objective, its useless. He has good guns, but provides almost no challenge to the enemy team - where almost any other defender has some kind of obstacle to get past - from traps, to shields, to cams/intel, to electric, to drone denial. A vigil CAN be useful, but if he loses his first 1v1 encounter, unless he played cautious and wasted time, he probably provided nothing to the team. For Vigil to provide more benefit to the team than a Mute, Bandit or Jager is nearly impossible - he basically has to get more kills. Nothing else will do. Same with Alibi. Her gadget provides very little utility. Now for Monty. Firstly he's a utility sponge. He absorbs all the impacts and C4s of the enemy team. Secondly he takes their attention. When i use him on a few sites, i'm able to distract 2 or 3 defenders at a time, keeping them looking at me, while im pointing/calling out their locations. Third he's an excellent defuser carrier. And he's without a doubt the best planter in the game, by far. Its not even close. Fifth, even after all the nerfs, he's still pretty decent 1v1. If you can get even a 3v3 and one side has a Monty, they should win. He's a moving drone, that can kill if given a chance. In my opinion, unless they are a noob, you shouldnt complain when you see a Monty on your team. Instead you should follow or stay close to them, use them as a means to get easy kills."},

Vigil excels in that like nobody else, not only because he has a good gun, but against experienced, attackers, his ability makes him difficult to pin down because good attackers never rush, they always drone out and ping positions.Nobody is rushing base, and if they do, they're going to quickly be met with a lot of nasty utility with any team unless they're comatose."},

I've seen many good IQ players just kill Vigil players through walls / floors, same goes for Jackal (if not banned), Nomad, Gridlock, Monty, etc.My point is VIgil useful? Of course yes! Is Vigil the most useful defender ever? Nope; I argue even Echo, Valkyrie, Jager, Aruni, Maestro, Melusi, Mute, Mozzie, etc are more useful than him ON A COORDINATED TEAM. If it's SoloQ and the attackers are mediocre / not coordinated, yes Vigil is a very strong operator. However as soon the attackers are somehow competent he can delay the attackers for a few seconds at best.Montagne is only useful in a coordinated team imho of course, in SoloQ he's a coin toss you depend that your team is competent & hope the defenders are morons or not have comms at all."},

{"r6": "Originally posted by UbiYubble:Originally posted by GameSmashDash:That would explain why people play Jager so much, after taking him for a spin I see why people love playing him. I feel like Jager hits that happy medium between being useful and fun to play. There are quite a few ops that sit in that same boat as well like Alibi, Monty, etc. I mean Jager is simple and effective. He's basically like Ash. Also, why did you nerf Jager's rifle? It ain't like it's gonna effect Jager's pick rate, his ability is still integral to defense. Maybe try buffing Wamai. Think Ubisoft think!"},

Oh no he lost some bullets; I wouldn't really call what Jager got a \"nerf\" the gun kickback makes it more usable for me in play and if anything after this recent \"nerf\" I'm using more Jager players!

{"r6": "Originally posted by Baby Ghoul:Originally posted by sockinvaders:Ok lets compare Vigil and Montagne. Vigil provides next to no utility in terms of secondary gadget - impacts help him roam, but if the team rush objective, its useless. He has good guns, but provides almost no challenge to the enemy team - where almost any other defender has some kind of obstacle to get past - from traps, to shields, to cams/intel, to electric, to drone denial. A vigil CAN be useful, but if he loses his first 1v1 encounter, unless he played cautious and wasted time, he probably provided nothing to the team. For Vigil to provide more benefit to the team than a Mute, Bandit or Jager is nearly impossible - he basically has to get more kills. Nothing else will do. Same with Alibi. Her gadget provides very little utility. Now for Monty. Firstly he's a utility sponge. He absorbs all the impacts and C4s of the enemy team. Secondly he takes their attention. When i use him on a few sites, i'm able to distract 2 or 3 defenders at a time, keeping them looking at me, while im pointing/calling out their locations. Third he's an excellent defuser carrier. And he's without a doubt the best planter in the game, by far. Its not even close. Fifth, even after all the nerfs, he's still pretty decent 1v1. If you can get even a 3v3 and one side has a Monty, they should win. He's a moving drone, that can kill if given a chance. In my opinion, unless they are a noob, you shouldnt complain when you see a Monty on your team. Instead you should follow or stay close to them, use them as a means to get easy kills. You could make an argument that Montage isn't as useless as the majority of the playerbase sees him (due to personal experience and stats), but it just doesn't really stick when you say not only is Montage a perfectly fine operator, but also he's better than Vigil.That's where you lose me entirely because a roamer's whole utility rests on thinning out the herd coming to attack the base. Vigil excels in that like nobody else, not only because he has a good gun, but against experienced, attackers, his ability makes him difficult to pin down because good attackers never rush, they always drone out and ping positions.Nobody is rushing base, and if they do, they're going to quickly be met with a lot of nasty utility with any team unless they're comatose. The guy below your response hits the nail on the head. I'm not saying Montagne beats Vigil in a 1v1. I'm saying if i have an attacking team with a Monty, i dont mind so long as i have the required amount of utility, which could be just an Ace and Thatcher. To me, Monty is as good as a Nomad, or Jackal, or Flores, or any of those guys. On the other hand, if i have a defensive team with an outside wall to protect, or many windows facing objective - im hoping and praying for a jager or wamai (ideally both), a Valk or Maestro (ill take both), a mozzie or mute, a trap operator or two. If i see someone choose Vigil, someone choose Alibi, someone choose Doc or Rook, i'm like 'FFS!!! why dont people play some unselfish utility that will help the entire team. For example top floor or basement Consulate. Or bedroom or basement Chalet, or armory Border. Actually there's few bomb sites where i dont want atleast 4 useful team ops. Theres usually only enough space for a single Vigil type, low utility player."},

This maximizes framerate but it also increases latency since frames have to 'wait in line' to be rendered. Nvidia's Reflex SDK dynamically reduces the render queue by keeping the CPU in perfect sync with the GPU. This also reduces pressure on the CPU so that games can sample a mouse input at the last possible moment.In short: Reflex's low latency mode reduces the work that your CPU has to do by making it work together with your GPU more efficiently, thus reducing the amount of 'backlog' your GPU has and as such reducing the overall system latency. As an added benefit, the reduced stress on the CPU allows mouse inputs to be 'recorded' at the last possible moment, thus further decreasing latency and increasing responsiveness.

Why the events nowadays have no challenges that guaranteed us alpha packs from this event? Why Esporst alphapacks have duplicates(we have to watch 4 hours just to get one)? Why I keep getting charms? Why some skins or charms that are very boring are legendary/epic? Why I can't get nice uniforms from common items like from blood orchid or chimera?\nI grind all day long to get a single alpha pack for a single skin and all I want is to get rewarded with a nice skin, not duplicate and not a freakin charm.\nAlso, how come the skins nowadays are so expensive? Bundeswehr skin used to be 5000 renown, some other skins were 2500, even common uniforms were cheaper.\nWhy I need to pay so much r6 coins for a single bundle?  Why do we get so few renown in Siege?\nWhy people quit in mid games? It should be a penalty for every mode. Why I keep getting bad teammates? Why ash hitbox is so small? Why people kill me instantly aiming in my upper chest/neck? Why the headshot hitbox is so easy in a game that any headshot is a instakill? Why blitz or even blackbeard is so trash now? Why the devs don't balance things out, so that every single operator is usable(there are tons of fans rework, even for jackal, that should be played by a person that has good map knowledge)? Why a SHOOTER game is based now on gadgets, instead of gun fights(and please don't give me TaCtIcAl ShOoTeR argument)? Why spawnpeek is allowed in a slow paced game? How can I convince a friend to play with me, if in the minute he spawns in bank, a rook with a mp5 insta kills him?\nHow can a 3 armor operator outgun Kali's sniper, or even glaz? Why I keep getting headshoted through my shield as blitz? Why ash hitbox is so small and not fixed yet?\nAnyway I could keep all day talking about those things. I really searched for all those things that I've complained, so it's not only me that complains about it. I'm not the most experienced player, far from that. My point is that R6 Siege in the stage that it is now, it's a love hate relationship for me. And right now, it's really on the hate side.\nTLDR: Bad luck in alpha packs and not feeling rewarded playing the game.

Give other champs some love.Some options don't seem to be working, mic volume of other players, idk if this is just me, but I am getting tired of getting my ears blasted by someone with a 2 euro budget microphone, especially when I am trying to listen of footsteps in the middle of the game. By now I remember to always lower it, for most times, but that shouldn't be a thing.

Due to the scripts they use, the system can't detect them as afk and not everyone really bothers with sending tons of footage of them to get them banned.Also, I've noticed that some afk bots actually play normally on regular intervals, so when Ubi does decide to monitor them, there's a chance that they're playing normally and won't get banned at the moment."},

Exact same spot right now, 3550 hours, never had a problem playing this game up until about 2 seasons ago. People can call \"burnout\" all they want, but for 3k hours I could play for an entire day and come back the next? Something about that has changed and the game isn't at fault for it?Part of me thinks it's just a burnout from competitive games in general, but then I go over to Apex, then I go over to League, then I play literally anything else and I'm just fine and dandy, and I see no problems at all.I play 1 game of this new event, 1 game. TK'ed first round, called names by a bunch of level 60's who sound like they're in their 20's with asperger syndrome, game thrown as they kill themself with impacts... I don't really have much to say, I can't say I woke up with a lot to say about Siege today, I was hoping I could have some fun on the new event and maybe give my opinion tomorrow on it, but it seems that's not the case, as the exact same thing happened 2 times in a row, as I got TK'ed for the second game by entirely different people. I just don't know, I play other games, I don't have a problem at all, but then I go back to Siege and it's just an all-round negative experience that makes me want to just call it a day"},

Smurfs, hitreg, toxicity, cheaters, balance, lack of new content, everything. I stick around because I genuinely enjoy the game, but the cons outweigh the pros by at least a 100 tons.Correct me if I'm wrong, or if ANYONE disagrees with me on this, but I think everything is getting worse by the day, Ubisoft has let the infection go unnoticed, and it's looking pretty bad, yet they still refuse to treat it with even the most basic of medicines that would take 2 seconds to conjure up Nah you're not wrong. Things are worse than I remember. I returned after two seasons, and was in a one season hiatus before that short session too so it's been three seasons since I binged this game properly. I have never seen, maybe I've been lucky but it's true, one of those renown farming bots before that just afks throughout an entire match. Well I've had four of them these last two days, in ranked matches just spazzing a shot up into the air and then one into the ground, and they said they're commonplace nowadays.I still like the game though, but that's because I've resigned to these things and decided I'd spend this season just messing about trying new stuff, practice and have fun. It would be impossible taking it serious even if I wanted to, or at least a very painful exercise in futility."},

Well you always have unranked, casual, Thunt, custom games (if you have 10 players), etc.Also if your squad is \"MMR IS VITAL FOR FUN\", shouldn't you guys be playing a even more competitive gamemode, like the GO4 tournaments on sundays or the R6 Faceit mini tournaments?"},

{"r6": "yo mamma"},
{"r6": "Attack: Fuze (not on hostage)/Ace. Both are good operators. Ace is a little better as he has breach and every team needs at least one breacher. The reason why I think they're good beginner operators is that the AK-12 is so easy to use. You'll almost certainly get a kill and stay in the game long enough to learn the game.I also think that IQ is useful for learning most the defender devices and camera placements. She's also a good operator since Valkyrie is high in the meta. The G8A1 is also a great gun for a 3 speed.Operators I'd avoid are Montage and Blitz. They're just objectively bad and anyone that gets in the habit of using them seems to have an issue with letting go of them. Specifically Blitz as I know there's some cheesy things you can do with him, but it just doesn't pay off in the long run.Defense: Utility is the focus for defense. You should always be asking what does your team need, even more so than attack where you can get away with just a good gun and determination in most cases.You can never go wrong with Jager. He's a decent 2-2 with a great gun in the 416-C Carbine, but specifically his gadget is really easy to use. You just set it and forget it and boom you're being useful to the team.Bandit/Kaid are really good operators to get used to as well. Kaid is better for hatches and sometimes covering more space, but Bandit has a great gun and he's faster. You'll always need some kind of anti-breach on defense.I'd also say that Mute is a good anti-breach/anti-intel operator too. You could also learn how to make rotation holes with him too. Learning which walls to keep open for rotation is important. Pick his shotgun for the rotation holes, and you can rely on the SMG-11. Him and Smoke can get away with shotgun primaries as the SMG-11 will get the job done for defense.Aruni is great for beginners too. She can create rotation holes with her passive, her robot arm punch, which is unique to her. Her Surya gates are a good way to slow down the attackers. Her gadget is indestructible, but anything that hits the laser (operators, drones, grenades, etc.) will disable it for a short period of time and destroy whatever went through it or damage the operator. Bullets will not disable it. Her Surya gates can be enabled once again when they stop flickering by simply hitting the eye again. Remember this even if you're not playing Aruni. Both her primaries are fine and mostly comes down to preference.Also please don't be that person that doesn't fortify. That's a very bad habit to get into. If you're not playing a roamer and you're not setting up something else, do not just sit there."},

I stick around because I genuinely enjoy the game, but the cons outweigh the pros by at least a 100 tons.Correct me if I'm wrong, or if ANYONE disagrees with me on this, but I think everything is getting worse by the day, Ubisoft has let the infection go unnoticed, and it's looking pretty bad, yet they still refuse to treat it with even the most basic of medicines that would take 2 seconds to conjure up"},

You're telling me that to see a skin that's paid for with real money, it can only be seen (unless somehow logical people fail to ban jackal in the more common ranked matches) by playing a casual portion of the game. \nwhile i enjoy the content coming out for siege i can't help but wonder who dropped the ball on this and the halloween skins from 2020.

If that sounds too daunting, maybe you won't enjoy it. That being said, you already have 1 huge advantage, you have friends to play with. I tell people that pick this game up that you need to approach it like a fighting game. You are going to lose a lot because you can't just button mash your way through against experienced players, but as you gradually come to learn the nuances of the game and the matchups, you will really enjoy it far more than some braindead shooter because it actually has depth and isn't meant to coddle casuals like most mainstream games.

The super pro-gamer G-Fuel comp players are still out there but from what i've seen, theyre pretty up front about wanting to sweat and win. Nothing wrong with that, but id rather have fun than get mad and blame your team every time you get an L.  Itd definitely be worth it to look up a summary of the major updates, a lot of pretty big changes happened that would take you off guard if its been a while (pooled reenforcements, lots of ops getting their 'nades removed / secondaries swapped with the poopy gonne-6, echo drones not invisible any more, Zofia cant withstand any more, etc.)"},

There isn't a ruby rank in this game @OP. Also you could just google \"rainbow six siege leaked operators\", then search one of the few trust worthy & reliable sources we had over the years.

At this moment, I'm not aware of any plans to implement an abandonment penalty for Quick Match. Casual, or Quick Match in this instance, is meant to be a more \"casual\" way to play Siege and something players play when they don't have time for an Unranked or Ranked game. Introducing a penalty for leaving QM would essentially no longer make it casual since you'd be obligated to stick around. On the flip side, it's not fun to have people leave games, no matter what mode you're playing on, so I do understand that. What are some other ways you can think of to cut down on the amount of Quick Match leavers that you've seen? Perhaps some sort of incentive for players to stick around in matches or something like that?"},

If you think you should be allowed to behave the way you do, but get upset at the idea of then being exclusively matched with players like you, maybe you should rethink your behavior.Any other genuine reason for quitting mid-match aside from simply getting pissy that you got spawnpeeked/failed a spawnpeek/lost a round/whatever shouldn't be common enough to really hamper your experience that much. And besides who cares? If you quit for whatever legit reason and then get temporarily marked as a quitter for a single match who cares? That's what I hear whenever somebody suggests any kind of penalty for quitting in casual: \"who cares if somebody leaves?

Blackbeards utility just makes the advantage very clear, without him needing to play very smart. Thats what players hate about blackbeard, but he doesnt deserve to be thrown away with his shield being useless, which is the situation blackbeard is in right now. \nThe concept: Blackbeards shield is utility that cause no big disadvantage to the user. Players can just equip it anywhere and there is no point in taking it of the weapon. I say, make the shield from a metal so you cannot see through so it pretty much obscures your vision. In order to again see normaly you would have to take down the shield or aim down sights. Laso I would say giving him 2 shields was a mistake, I would give him one. Another problem is that blackbeard cannot work without his shield because his weapons are weak. MK17 has slow fire rate and cannot stand against high fire rate smg's. SR25 has low damage for a marksman rifle and deagle is unreliable. Write me down your Thoughts."},
{"r6": "think you should try to find R6 Discussion page, instead of sending it to Steam."},
{"r6": "better concept would be to leave the shield he has now, but add something like glaz scope, so if blackbeard is not moving, he can see through smoke, or maybe it can filter out flashes or something....and it can take 1-2 shots before it's destroyed...."},
{"r6": "Thats a neat idea. Id definitely like to see BB reworked. As of right now, its laughable that his shield basically gives you a millisecond of extra time before getting head-shottet, since practically any weapon can 1 shot his shield. If I have a fast fire rate weapon, sometimes I wont even realize it was BB since most guns will just shred straight through his shield."},

Additionally, operators cough loudly. Effect applies to both sides.\nCan be intercepted by both wamai and jager's ADS. Gas lasts for 7 seconds and similar visibility with Smoke's gas nades (different color maybe?).

Nope it's not going to make Zofia / Ash / Sledge / Iana useless, it's giving attackers more operators to bring to the table instead of playing the same operators 24/7. This situation reminds me of the \"Tachanka rework is going to be so BROKEN AND OP\", yet nowadays he is getting multiple buffs due being a very lackluster operator. Ubi can try buffed Glaz in the TTS and gather feedback, like they did with the Nokk buffs.Edit: Also if necessary defenders can adapt back to the Mozzie + Mute intel deny meta OR go a full DoT comp OR go full intel comp, etc. Attackers on the other hand all they can do atm is bring explosive utility + utility burners 24/7 or they get \u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665 if the defenders are competent players."},

{"r6": "Let's face it, Siege isn't looking great right now. While it might technically be more balanced than where it was a year or two ago, it's simply much less fun. The spark and uniqueness of Siege just isn't there anymore and the current direction the game is taking is probably going to kill it. All things considered, I think Siege needs to look back on what made it so popular, the ways the players have *adapted* to the game. In my opinion, unless something is undeniably broken, the game shouldn't *adapt* to fit the players. Some operators were just doomed from the start, while some operators were bound for success from the start (Jager). If Siege truly wants to get better, it needs to add more player freedom to inspire creativity. **The reason why the current direction is bad is because it limits Player Freedom by restricting ways to play the game.** The new Maps and Map Reworks have been terrible for player freedom because they narrow down the number of ways to play the Objectives. \nFirst Things First:\n-add the old run-out times back (I know they can be annoying but they punish players who are off guard and add creativity to operators like Valk)\n-add some ACOGs back (probably not all of them)\n-stop handling the pro league so poorly, inconsistently, and translucently\n-implement a better anti-cheat software\n-stop basing the meta on utility rather than on skill or creativity\n-add variety to the game (better maps, playlist for fun game modes we've seen in the past, bring back outbreak, etc.)\nI know I'm definitely not the only one that is thinking this and I really want to see some retroactive changes coming to Siege.

The game's not going to be fixed in a day, and it's going to take a lot of time and effort to get this game to an optimal state again, where we're going ahead, not back every patch and update. Maybe, we'll see. To think the games future is one of a fun-based and ambitious team shooter is naive to say the least, but it doesn't stop me from playing.

Siege has lost it's original identity & it's atmosphere. Nowadays is a weird mix between hero shooter (Overwatch, Valorant, Apex Legends) with MOBA atmosphere (like Dota 2, LoL), but that at the same time tries to be a competitive FPS (like CSGO) with the unque gimmick of partial map destruction and CTU's name throwed into the mix.@OP I agree with your last 3 points. You got my support."},

It's a hero shooter, but at launch it didn't feel like one, nor did it feel like it was intended to be one. Instead of just having a unique military piece of hardware with a CT skin and minor background glazed over it, what we have now is some anime level gobbledegook that's a shame to the Rainbow Six name, trying to create unique personalities and characters, WHICH I'D BE FINE WITH MAKE NO MISTAKE! But they're not even interesting characters, Overwatch, League, Apex, all of them have vibrant personalities, voicelines, and interactions that make the character feel alive and justify their place in the game, Siege does not. It's a waste of time and burns the \"counter terrorist training\" theme the game has created, and makes me cringe, which isn't a good sign from a long time fan of the game.If they want to turn this game into a modern \"character based teamfight game\" the least they could do is add some spice, because right now, to me, it looks like a shoddy attempt to sell cosmetics. I'll always demand the highest standards from Siege, I don't care what the dev's want it to be plot-wise, I'll still play the game, I just want them to do it right, otherwise I'll complain about the ethics of it"},

If you had any actionables to put to this, what do you think they would be? I think when it comes to shields, a huge frustration killer would be to add an across-screen knife system by holding V and not tapping it, which would take longer to perform and instead of knifing only affecting the crosshair, it slices across the screen killing anything within a melee range. As a cherry on the cake, I'd like the hole punching in walls to be a knife jab, instead of a swipe or kick from the butt of the gun. Right now melee is completely broken, and it would cost too much time and money to completely rework the hitreg system as some have asked, and I think a minor rework of the melee system, or at least a new minor feature, would massively improve QoL for little effort and help solve the shield issue, if only slightly"},

{"r6": "I can't choose the sensitivity of the mouse"},
{"r6": "Hello! I understand that the sensitivity of the mouse is adjusted individually, I watched a lot of videos but still can not choose my sensitivity.\nI'll start with the fact that I used to play on a very high DPI - about 4000 and, at the same time, had a high sensitivity of the mouse. And I played gold rank regularly, even though I just started playing this game then.\nThen I reduced the DPI to 800 and the sensitivity to 25. It was very unusual to even use folders on the desktop due to the low sensitivity of the mouse. Then I constantly reduced my sensitivity. I played at 15 15, then at 10 10. I got used to getting back in shape for a year but never came back.\nI will not say that I became a noob - I killed a lot and made aces but I was sitting on the bronze and my form was far from what it was before. Perhaps the muscular memory did not allow the hand to move, but only the wrists. It was as if I was restrained and could not move fully, but I accepted it because I understood that I should try to play in a low sense and I wanted to learn to play in a new way.\nYesterday I decided to change the dpi to 400. Again, I barely move the cursor on the desktop - I will relearn (I could change the dpi only in the game, but it seems to me that if it is the same dpi everywhere, the hand will get used to moving more). But I can't set the correct sensitivity.\nI watched the video, they say that you need to make a 180-degree rotation without tension and a 360-degree rotation from one end of the mouse mat to the other. These things I can do without aiming at a sensitivity in the range of 15 15 to 20 20. In the sight I make a 45 degree rotation. I also aimed at different points and moved the sight from one target to another.\nIn anti-terror, I felt normal - I killed targets without problems. However, I noticed some discomfort in turns and movements. And although the advice is perfect - in practice it is far from true. Since the sensitivity on the desktop is reduced, I understand that over time I will get used to it and you can put the sensitivity in the game a little less than ideal. Also, I don't know what value to put on the sensitivity of ADS. I understand that now each weapon has its own individual sensitivity, but I have no idea what number to put there.\nAnd I would like to ask - maybe someone had a similar experience and can suggest something. Or come into the game with me and help set up in practice?)"},
{"r6": "Going from a high sens like 1600 to 400 is a big step so it will take about a month or two to adapt to it. At low sens like 9/9/83 or 12/12/35... You have to flick and be a lot more active with your arm movements. If there's a vertical/horizontal component that you can't quite get used to yet, just slightly turn up the sens from the 1:1 setting until you're more comfortable with it. Alternatively, you can also practice activities like Gridshot, Spidershot 180 or tracking activities on aimlab so that you'd be more comfortable with a low sens..."},

Then this effect disappeared and I had to strain again to get into my head. But when I put 400 dpi - the bullets again easily fly into the head. I can get used to the new meaning. It's just that I'm not used to moving my hand and I don't want drastically huge changes."},

Avoid newcomer mode and don't put a lot of effort into winning or stats in casual modes, focus more on figuring out what you could have done better.

{"r6": "I can't choose the sensitivity of the mouse"},
{"r6": "Hello! I understand that the sensitivity of the mouse is adjusted individually, I watched a lot of videos but still can not choose my sensitivity.\nI'll start with the fact that I used to play on a very high DPI - about 4000 and, at the same time, had a high sensitivity of the mouse. And I played gold rank regularly, even though I just started playing this game then.\nThen I reduced the DPI to 800 and the sensitivity to 25. It was very unusual to even use folders on the desktop due to the low sensitivity of the mouse. Then I constantly reduced my sensitivity. I played at 15 15, then at 10 10. I got used to getting back in shape for a year but never came back.\nI will not say that I became a noob - I killed a lot and made aces but I was sitting on the bronze and my form was far from what it was before. Perhaps the muscular memory did not allow the hand to move, but only the wrists. It was as if I was restrained and could not move fully, but I accepted it because I understood that I should try to play in a low sense and I wanted to learn to play in a new way.\nYesterday I decided to change the dpi to 400. Again, I barely move the cursor on the desktop - I will relearn (I could change the dpi only in the game, but it seems to me that if it is the same dpi everywhere, the hand will get used to moving more). But I can't set the correct sensitivity.\nI watched the video, they say that you need to make a 180-degree rotation without tension and a 360-degree rotation from one end of the mouse mat to the other. These things I can do without aiming at a sensitivity in the range of 15 15 to 20 20. In the sight I make a 45 degree rotation. I also aimed at different points and moved the sight from one target to another.\nIn anti-terror, I felt normal - I killed targets without problems. However, I noticed some discomfort in turns and movements. And although the advice is perfect - in practice it is far from true. Since the sensitivity on the desktop is reduced, I understand that over time I will get used to it and you can put the sensitivity in the game a little less than ideal. Also, I don't know what value to put on the sensitivity of ADS. I understand that now each weapon has its own individual sensitivity, but I have no idea what number to put there.\nAnd I would like to ask - maybe someone had a similar experience and can suggest something. Or come into the game with me and help set up in practice?)"},

The SMG-11 is a pretty accurate gun and recoil's mostly vertical; so it's the best secondary SMG of the bunch and you can even roam with the smg-11 and engage mid-distance targets. It's not like the bearing 9 where there's serious horizontal components to recoil patterns. **1)Don't pull the mouse down with too much force, you just drag it a little. Your shots start to deviate from its intended path when you pull on it. It's like Buck's C8, you just drag it gently upon firing the first round and the gun will follow where you want it to go. Just try it in t-hunt.**2)Start controlling recoil as soon as you fire the gun, not when the gun starts to jump. 3)Gun's got limited ammo but you can still fire one mag into a white wall during prep phase if you want to familiarize before the match starts.4)Unless you're going for one-taps, don't stop firing until you get a confirmed kill on the kill-feed."},
{"r6": "I can't choose the sensitivity of the mouse"},
{"r6": "Hello! I understand that the sensitivity of the mouse is adjusted individually, I watched a lot of videos but still can not choose my sensitivity.\nI'll start with the fact that I used to play on a very high DPI - about 4000 and, at the same time, had a high sensitivity of the mouse. And I played gold rank regularly, even though I just started playing this game then.\nThen I reduced the DPI to 800 and the sensitivity to 25. It was very unusual to even use folders on the desktop due to the low sensitivity of the mouse. Then I constantly reduced my sensitivity. I played at 15 15, then at 10 10. I got used to getting back in shape for a year but never came back.\nI will not say that I became a noob - I killed a lot and made aces but I was sitting on the bronze and my form was far from what it was before. Perhaps the muscular memory did not allow the hand to move, but only the wrists. It was as if I was restrained and could not move fully, but I accepted it because I understood that I should try to play in a low sense and I wanted to learn to play in a new way.\nYesterday I decided to change the dpi to 400. Again, I barely move the cursor on the desktop - I will relearn (I could change the dpi only in the game, but it seems to me that if it is the same dpi everywhere, the hand will get used to moving more). But I can't set the correct sensitivity.\nI watched the video, they say that you need to make a 180-degree rotation without tension and a 360-degree rotation from one end of the mouse mat to the other. These things I can do without aiming at a sensitivity in the range of 15 15 to 20 20. In the sight I make a 45 degree rotation. I also aimed at different points and moved the sight from one target to another.\nIn anti-terror, I felt normal - I killed targets without problems. However, I noticed some discomfort in turns and movements. And although the advice is perfect - in practice it is far from true. Since the sensitivity on the desktop is reduced, I understand that over time I will get used to it and you can put the sensitivity in the game a little less than ideal. Also, I don't know what value to put on the sensitivity of ADS. I understand that now each weapon has its own individual sensitivity, but I have no idea what number to put there.\nAnd I would like to ask - maybe someone had a similar experience and can suggest something. Or come into the game with me and help set up in practice?)"},
{"r6": "Going from a high sens like 1600 to 400 is a big step so it will take about a month or two to adapt to it. At low sens like 9/9/83 or 12/12/35... You have to flick and be a lot more active with your arm movements. If there's a vertical/horizontal component that you can't quite get used to yet, just slightly turn up the sens from the 1:1 setting until you're more comfortable with it. Alternatively, you can also practice activities like Gridshot, Spidershot 180 or tracking activities on aimlab so that you'd be more comfortable with a low sens..."},

It's just that I'm not used to moving my hand and I don't want drastically huge changes."},

For medium range, it requires some skill and experience with the weapon to spray with it at that range, but bursting is also pretty good."},

{"r6": "@OP if you're going to \"mag dump\" / full auto all the time with the SMG-11 use the compensator, if you're going for mid range - close range (aka from 8m to 15m) use the flash hider. Other than that the recoil of the weapon is mostly vertical with a bit of horizontal recoil to the left and only a neglible tiny bit to the right, you can practice in Thunt disarm bomb or protect hostage.Operators with the SMG-11 are: Sledge; Smoke; Mute; Amaru. Good luck."},
{"r6": "First of all use Flash Hider so you can burst the gun at least. Once you get good at bursts you can learn to control the spray. That's my 2 cents anyway."},

{"r6": "It only has 17 shots.  the best use for the weapon is to tap fire.  You need to aim for the head because the weapon has had multiple nerfs to many aspects of the weapon.  The range drop off coupled with the recoil means you wont be getting kills with it without a headshot.  Tap firing and accuracy are the only real talking points of the weapon.  Just use the reflex or holo sites, foregrip and flash hider as your attachments.  Rest is just accuracy, practice and shot placement."},

{"r6": "Everyone except Ubisoft seems to agree that the issue is how much utility his set it and forget it gadget provides.They've addressed nothing that makes him a must-pick. They're just nerfing his gun in the hopes that they'll make him feel so awful to play that people will pick him less.Why is that better than simply changing his gadget?While I agree that in addition to his gadget his gun is way too good, it's not why we see Jager every match. His easy to use gadget and the utility it counters makes him a must pick.That's the difference between him and an Ela/Twitch. Their gadgets are nice, but nothing that was meta defining. Their guns without the recoil changes were truly some of the most oppressive to face in this game. They still can be if you understand the recoil, but it's certainly not for everyone which is what they intended.The current 416-C Cabrine can't hold a candle to what the F2 and Scorpion EVO 3 A1 once were before their nerfs.

He always had an insanely high pick rate since the start.I don't really want to see every weapon in the game having a random recoil just like the SMG-12."},

{"r6": "Well i wonder if Ash's R4-C is the next one the chopping block for magazine and recoil since she's become the equivalent of Jager for attackers, honestly wouldn't mind since it's there's never a been a reason to NOT use the R4-C even when she lost her ACOG. Iana, Gridlock and Nomad are better example of characters that have guns with different mag sizes being a relevant choice with both being valid.\nEDIT:they made a comment on jager \nEDIT2: they removed tactical realism lol"},
{"r6": "They want characters to be know for their gadget and not their weapons, characters shouldn't have good gadgets and good guns (despite ash existing since beggining), case in point is how good valkyrie is despite having an peashooter in terms of guns, and how okay-ish is thatcher loudout but his gadget is pretty much mandatory.Of course this raises a lot of questions, at this point i think they want all operators to be similar to thermite where his guns are okay but what REALLY matters is him doing his job as hard breacher, i guess this is why they also did the same with melusi of first tackling her fragging power to then see if her gadget on her own is the issue of her full power with a strong loudout.Problem that i see with this is that they are creating more and more ultra specialized gadgets that are not useful all-rounders that are viable in most scenarios to be part of a meta but just things too niche so they become weak because their gimmick is never applied (warden and nokk are prime examples of that)"},
{"r6": "Originally posted by SirPotato:Originally posted by Arash The Great:I mean you can't have everything. Jager has a decent weapon and live saving(didn't mean to sound dramatic) gadget. Either they have to rework how his gadget works or they should change his weapon.Another alternative which Ubi is a fan of is to nerf the \u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665 out of the primary until it becomes useless Originally posted by Mr. H.U.N.K.:Glad to see the Thermite / Ace changes! Interesting to see Jackal nerf when his elite is the next one that should be in the store, wonder when they will rework him.Finally they noticed that Tachanka post rework was still lackluster and buffed him! Hopefully by next patch they either buff the dmg per bullet in his LMG or (if plausible in this buggy game engine) the RoF of his LMG.As for the Jager nerf, not bad but it should've been a nerf to 20+1 plus \"strong\" vertical recoil and a tiny bit of horizontal recoil like current Buck C8 & Twitch F2. Wonder if they will nerf Ash, Zofia, Valkyrie, Ace/Fuze (Ak-12); Vigil (K1A); IQ's & Amaru G8A1 LMG, etc. weapons next.Still waiting for: Jackal rework, Dokkaebi rework, Blitz rework, Clash rework, shield operators (attackers) fix of hit boxes and/or rework; Blackbeard rework; Glaz rework; Goyo rework; Warden buffs or rework; Melusi Rework; Maybe buff Aruni laser gate to recharge in 20 seconds instead of 30 seconds? Valkyrie nerf (either remove the ability to throw cameras outside. I mean Mozzie drones & Echo drones can't go outside why should valk get a freebie pass? OR give it the \"heavy\" throw trajectory of the nitro cell / C4 + remove sound from the cameras); SoloQ vs SoloQ matchmaking; 5 stack vs 5 stack matchmaking; shooting range / firing range; Thunt overhaul / rework; Custom games overhaul / rework; permanent arcade / event playlist to spice things up; night maps in casual / quick play; among other changes etc. For Jager, they are just repeating the same mistakes with Melusi.The weapon was never the issue, if his weapon gets bad and is the reason why he is always picked, then by that logic Vigil and Wamai will have 90% pickrate if the 416-C gets nerfed to the ground, which is surely not true.I don't even see a reason to nerf him at this point, -which makes me remember Wraith from ApexLegends, who also was always picked then they nerfed her to the ground and is still almost always picked-.I don't think they can reduce his pick rate. He always had an insanely high pick rate since the start.I don't really want to see every weapon in the game having a random recoil just like the SMG-12. Fair enough, the alternative would be nerf Jager and on top of that add a secondary gadget, that is a mini Jager ADS / Wamai Magnet. That way you encourage people to play other operators and still got similar utility to Jager (on top of their regular gadget, kinda like how the hard breach charge works atm), while also kicking in the nuts any CoD gun & run monkey plays, type of Jager players."},

{"r6": "Originally posted by Arash The Great:Originally posted by Weederick:J\u00e4gers recoil nerf could be the most relevant one to bring him down. Twitch went from highly to rarely picked. I hope the recoil nerfs arent too extreme, so he ends up like Ela, Buck and Twitch. Not fun to play with those guns Twitch gets rarely picked for several reasons:1. Seems like Flores is a better alternative simply because he has 2 normal drones, 4 RCXD drones and plus all of those can jump and they have more impact than shock drones2. F2 receiving nerfs3. Her \u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665 drones can't jump fot some stupid reason Twitchs popularity dropped hard after the recoil nerf. She was a nice 980 rpm comfort pick. If j\u00e4gers recoil takes a big hit, he will drop too since he is a hardhitting, low recoil comfortpick. I dont think his gadget could save his pickrate if the weapon sucks like elas. His gun could need a slight nerf, but they really need to chill with the severity of recoil nerfs."},

Heck i remember they saying warden was meant to be a jager alternative and he eas released as 3 armor, with a worse version of his current gadget, no explosives when smoke meta was already dead.They only appear to make decent ops when trying something that just so happens to overlap woth someone else such as mozzie being another intel denial compared to mute while also being different.Thats why they need to start looking at lesser picked ops such warden and actually make him a good jager alternative, give nokk that buff so she can affect the meta by going around it instead of being part of utility economy, find ways to make glaz interact more with the game then \u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665 smoke memes and so on"},
{"r6": "As for Mira hard counters, just buff DMR's so they can destroy bullet proof gadgets in 10-5 bullets depending on their size. Maestro cam? 5 bullets, Melusi Banshee? 5 bullets. Castle barricade & Mira Black mirror? 10 bullets; Deployable shields? 10 bullets. etc.Voila now attackers can pick operators with DMR's to counter partially the utility meta (at cost of fire power / high RoF weapons) OR bring the gonne 6 operators (that should be changed for shotguns with HE shells, like you have suggested a few weeks ago) OR bring the usual Ash & Zofia + operators with frags / explosive gadgets.Regarding Nokk, yes her rework / buff should come in-game however Kapkan traps still should go off & dmg her, those things are a laser not a \"smart\" detection system like the motion sensor in the proximity alarm & melusi banshee.As for Warden, what about on top of his gadget give him a backpack, that has a rechargable (each 30 seconds, and must be done manually via an animation) anti projectile device? However he can also place the backpack on a surface to protect his teammates, and they can also recharge it. Also give warden a better SMG & better smg side arm (smg-11) OR replace the pistol with a pocket shotgun.Other balance changes: Give Glaz an underbarrel smoke greanade launcher with two charges, remove his regular smokes & give him the hardbreach gadget.Give Capitao back his flashbangs, replace his claymore OR maybe give him the gonne 6.Give Buck the gonne 6 but keep his pistol, like how they've done with Iana & Sam / Zero.Nerf Ash make the R4C have a 20 round magazine, increase the vertical recoil and a bit of the horizontal one; make ash a 2 speed - 2 armor.Maybe buff gonne 6 to 2 explosive rounds instead of the lackluster 1 shot?Add a new secondary gadget that works like a mini ADS with less range, and bigger cooldown time (20 seconds, instead of the 10 sec the \"normal\" ADS has) for defenders. So they don't have to always bring Jager, Wamai, Aruni, etc. idk if only 1 or 2 of those devices.Remove the 0.5 sec delay from the claymores.Rework shield operators (Montagne, Blitz, Clash & Fuze) and fix the attackers shield ops hit boxes, specially Blitz he might need a more wide shield or be back to 3 armor 1 speed, probably.Give Tachanka the x1.5 scope on his SMG and buff his LMG fire rate OR increase his DMG per bullet & destruction on the LMG, also swap Tachanka proximity mines for Smoke deployable shield, However give Smoke impact nades.Regarding the fire greanade launcher, increase the AoE to 2.2m (compared to the TTS buff of 1.9m) and increase the DMG per tick it does to 28 (atm i think it does only 10 per tick) Smoke does 33 per tick if i'm not mistaken. Increase fire duration to 9 seconds (compared to 7 sec in the TTS buff), also Smoke gas last 10 seconds.In his LMG reduce his Equip time to 0.5 secs (compared to the 0.65 sec in the TTS buff).My idea for a Jackal rework would be: Instead of a ping for all his team, once he scans the footstep it shows a ping (3 pings if green, 2 pings if Yellow, 1 Ping if red) with the room name the roamer last know position was, and it only shows it to Jackal. Also remove his shotgun and give him the gonne 6, remove smokes and give him flashbangs.For consistency sake, remove Caveira \"invisible\" footsteps against Jackal & remove Vigil \"invisibility\" against Lion scans. After all they removed the \"additional lore\" ability from Echo, Zofia & Ela in the past, why should Caveira & Vigil get a freebie?Buff IQ scanner to 30m and make quicker to swap between the gadget and her primary weapon OR allow her to ping the gadgets for her teammates through walls X amounts of seconds (that includes Vigil, Pulse, anyone using cameras, etc) If she pings an operator, the defender will get the \"you're detected\" warning as when you're spotted by a regular drone.Also nerf the G8A1 LMG recoil or remove the angled grip. Maestro does well with his LMG without an angled grip and both of those LMG got similar DPS stats and recoil patterns, also he's an 3 armor 1 speed operator, while IQ is a 1 armor 3 speed & Amaru is 2 armour 2 speed.If they ever rework Caveira to remove her 10 seconds of literal wallhacks and gave her a ping system like Jackal, Alibi, Lion, etc, give her a better smg with higher DPS & RoF with a x1.5 scope.As for Valkyrie, don't allow her to throw her cameras outside after all Echo drones & Mozzie drones can't go outside and placing a bullet proof camera or Maestro Evil Eye outside is a meme / suicide mission, and maybe give her MPX a bit of a dmg per bullet buff from 26 dmg per bullet to 28-30 dmg per bullet perhaps?Give Gridlock flashbangs or frag nades or the hardbreach gadget instead of her breaching charges,Give Fuze back his smoke grenades, remove the breaching charge, give him the SASG-12 and/or the VSNx9mm (the russian smg). give him the gonne 6, make him 2 speed - 2 armor.

He is situational and I would like to believe that more skilled players know how to counter him (example bandit trick timing).

Bandit tricking now is very hard to pull out and you would die most likely, so it is no use now in almost every site. But Kaid on the other hand is way easier to trick with and more effective, but to trick, defenders need to ban Thatcher, because he is the only operator who can counter Kaid tricking.Thatcher is being banned in all ranks and even in the PL for how easy it is to just press a button and have most defenders gadgets disabled, that \"nerf\" did nothing.

The recoil isn't too too bad, you just need to make your shots count, or back off if you can't hit the head on the first shot, which already puts you at a disadvantage regardless of the weapon you're using. Again, 70 damage is absolutely insane regardless of recoil, and it doesn't seem to have a dropoff too intense, it'll still probably do as much, if not more damage, than a Kapkan trap.The 5-7 is good ONLY if you can hit headshots, if you're going up against a gun with a high RoF, you'll lose a 1v1 that would otherwise be winnable with a Deagle. 40 damage is tiny, and especially with a high damage dropoff.

Wonder if they will nerf Ash, Zofia, Valkyrie, Ace/Fuze (Ak-12); Vigil (K1A); IQ's & Amaru G8A1 LMG, etc. weapons next.Still waiting for: Jackal rework, Dokkaebi rework, Blitz rework, Clash rework, shield operators (attackers) fix of hit boxes and/or rework; Blackbeard rework; Glaz rework; Goyo rework; Warden buffs or rework; Melusi Rework; Maybe buff Aruni laser gate to recharge in 20 seconds instead of 30 seconds? Valkyrie nerf (either remove the ability to throw cameras outside. I mean Mozzie drones & Echo drones can't go outside why should valk get a freebie pass? OR give it the \"heavy\" throw trajectory of the nitro cell / C4 + remove sound from the cameras); SoloQ vs SoloQ matchmaking; 5 stack vs 5 stack matchmaking; shooting range / firing range; Thunt overhaul / rework; Custom games overhaul / rework; permanent arcade / event playlist to spice things up; night maps in casual / quick play; among other changes etc."},

They're just nerfing his gun in the hopes that they'll make him feel so awful to play that people will pick him less.Why is that better than simply changing his gadget?While I agree that in addition to his gadget his gun is way too good, it's not why we see Jager every match. His easy to use gadget and the utility it counters makes him a must pick.That's the difference between him and an Ela/Twitch. Their gadgets are nice, but nothing that was meta defining. Their guns without the recoil changes were truly some of the most oppressive to face in this game. They still can be if you understand the recoil, but it's certainly not for everyone which is what they intended.The current 416-C Cabrine can't hold a candle to what the F2 and Scorpion EVO 3 A1 once were before their nerfs.

And at this point, I can say that Jager with UMP and a single ADS would still have 70% pick rate just because the community likes him.I actually like Ace's / Thermite's exchange, it gives more reason to pick Thermite in sites where Hard Breaching isn't so important.After all this time, they finally understand that Tachanka is weak by being extremely situational and a bad alternative to Smoke, but I don't think those changes will change that much.The change I hate the most is the removal of 1.0x sights on DMR's. Why remove these sights? Keeping them won't hurt and actually give more freedom for DMR players. I mean you can't have everything. Jager has a decent weapon and live saving(didn't mean to sound dramatic) gadget. Either they have to rework how his gadget works or they should change his weapon.Another alternative which Ubi is a fan of is to nerf the \u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665 out of the primary until it becomes useless Originally posted by Mr. H.U.N.K.:Glad to see the Thermite / Ace changes! Interesting to see Jackal nerf when his elite is the next one that should be in the store, wonder when they will rework him.Finally they noticed that Tachanka post rework was still lackluster and buffed him! Hopefully by next patch they either buff the dmg per bullet in his LMG or (if plausible in this buggy game engine) the RoF of his LMG.As for the Jager nerf, not bad but it should've been a nerf to 20+1 plus \"strong\" vertical recoil and a tiny bit of horizontal recoil like current Buck C8 & Twitch F2. Wonder if they will nerf Ash, Zofia, Valkyrie, Ace/Fuze (Ak-12); Vigil (K1A); IQ's & Amaru G8A1 LMG, etc. weapons next.Still waiting for: Jackal rework, Dokkaebi rework, Blitz rework, Clash rework, shield operators (attackers) fix of hit boxes and/or rework; Blackbeard rework; Glaz rework; Goyo rework; Warden buffs or rework; Melusi Rework; Maybe buff Aruni laser gate to recharge in 20 seconds instead of 30 seconds? Valkyrie nerf (either remove the ability to throw cameras outside. I mean Mozzie drones & Echo drones can't go outside why should valk get a freebie pass? OR give it the \"heavy\" throw trajectory of the nitro cell / C4 + remove sound from the cameras); SoloQ vs SoloQ matchmaking; 5 stack vs 5 stack matchmaking; shooting range / firing range; Thunt overhaul / rework; Custom games overhaul / rework; permanent arcade / event playlist to spice things up; night maps in casual / quick play; among other changes etc. For Jager, they are just repeating the same mistakes with Melusi.The weapon was never the issue, if his weapon gets bad and is the reason why he is always picked, then by that logic Vigil and Wamai will have 90% pickrate if the 416-C gets nerfed to the ground, which is surely not true.I don't even see a reason to nerf him at this point, -which makes me remember Wraith from ApexLegends, who also was always picked then they nerfed her to the ground and is still almost always picked-.I don't think they can reduce his pick rate. He always had an insanely high pick rate since the start.I don't really want to see every weapon in the game having a random recoil just like the SMG-12."},

Well the Reddit folks don't know what the hell they're talking about, as always. I believe it's purely down to your rank, and the highest rank on the enemy team that decides the payout. It's a stupid system, as there's been games where I've gotten massive amounts of kills, played support and went full team effort, only to lose the exact same amount I would have, which makes it very hard for me, and people I know, to play ranked without getting frustrated at teammates. If Ubi wants to build a toxic-free environment where people treat others with respect, a new matchmaking system would be a very good start"},

If people are ok with it then so what?\nNerfing Jackal would also not do anything, he will still be banned from unrank/ranked.\nNerfing the guns wont do anything, nerfing the skill would.\nNerf idea: \nJackal: Nerf the amount of time to scan, increase the interval between location pings\nJager: nerf the cooldown speed of the ADS, from 10s to 13s, reduce range from 5.5m to 5m\nBuff ideas:\nWamai: add the 1.5x to the Aug, be able to instantly place all 4 magnets till start.\nWhy? this will give a better reason for people to choose Wamai over Jager, hopefully decreasing the pick rate (as we know this is the only obsession of ubisoft).\nIf you think i said anything wrong, please correct me.\n**NERFING THE GUNS WONT CHANGE THE PICKRATE. NERFING THE SKILLS WOULD.**\nAnd I like how to nerf things, Ubisoft just goes straight to nerfing, but when it comes to Buffing operators which should normally be from the start (like Finka self reviving) they take all the time in the world to come to the decision. \nOperators imo that needs to be buffed:\nFinka: self reviving, if Doc can do it, why cant finka do it? (maybe for balancing, when she is down she can only boost herself and not her teammates)\nNokk: test server rework (come on give it already)\nAnd i would be tempted to say Vigil could use the same type of buff as Nokk, but I dont think its a good idea as he is already powerful.\nEdit: ok maybe nerf the guns, like reduce the dagame of the C7E and increase the recoil of the 416C, just dont touch the mag capacity\nEdit 2: I dont think Tachanka needed that buff.

{"r6": "The problem with a super high pick rate like Jager is that it's unhealthy for the game's balance. You can't have a character with a 95% pick rate while other characters literally have close to a 0% pick rate. The goal is to somewhat bring all the characters in line with each other. Not to mention that it also gets really stale seeing the same character played in every game, there needs to be a bit of diversity.Tachanka 100% needed that buff as he was significantly inferior to Smoke. As for the Jager and Jackal nerfs, although their gadgets play a huge role in why they are picked, without a doubt their powerful weapons is also a contributor to why they are picked a lot. I see people all the time play Jager solely for his gun and not his utility. Their guns are still powerful, the goal here is to slightly reduce their effectiveness and as a result reduce their pick rate.

If people are ok with it then so what?\nNerfing Jackal would also not do anything, he will still be banned from unrank/ranked.\nNerfing the guns wont do anything, nerfing the skill would.\nNerf idea: \nJackal: Nerf the amount of time to scan, increase the interval between location pings\nJager: nerf the cooldown speed of the ADS, from 10s to 13s, reduce range from 5.5m to 5m\nBuff ideas:\nWamai: add the 1.5x to the Aug, be able to instantly place all 4 magnets till start.\nWhy? this will give a better reason for people to choose Wamai over Jager, hopefully decreasing the pick rate (as we know this is the only obsession of ubisoft).\nIf you think i said anything wrong, please correct me.\n**NERFING THE GUNS WONT CHANGE THE PICKRATE. NERFING THE SKILLS WOULD.**\nAnd I like how to nerf things, Ubisoft just goes straight to nerfing, but when it comes to Buffing operators which should normally be from the start (like Finka self reviving) they take all the time in the world to come to the decision. \nOperators imo that needs to be buffed:\nFinka: self reviving, if Doc can do it, why cant finka do it? (maybe for balancing, when she is down she can only boost herself and not her teammates)\nNokk: test server rework (come on give it already)\nAnd i would be tempted to say Vigil could use the same type of buff as Nokk, but I dont think its a good idea as he is already powerful.\nEdit: ok maybe nerf the guns, like reduce the dagame of the C7E and increase the recoil of the 416C, just dont touch the mag capacity\nEdit 2: I dont think Tachanka needed that buff.

Their guns are still powerful, the goal here is to slightly reduce their effectiveness and as a result reduce their pick rate. But to be honest, I don't think it will really have that big of an impact, we'll see.I main Jager from first time I play siege, when i watch pro league match I just feel that Jager is 50% gun and 50% utility but most people playing him just for his gun.

The game is still going a very bad direction. Ubisoft still dont care about community, they are made the worst changes under 1 year I ever seen. For example they removed the nights map completely and Zofia revive. Also they are making maps to maze, reworking for no reason. They made a new \"Logo\" to a game, I also recommend then removing the Tom clancy's title because this is not the same game anymore.

Its clear from these charts every month that they don't care in the slightest about the complaints, they've decided the money comes from the top down, and so Ubisoft has no interest in how these changes worsen the game outside of the mega sweat zone.

For example they removed the nights map completely and Zofia revive. Also they are making maps to maze, reworking for no reason. They made a new \"Logo\" to a game, I also recommend then removing the Tom clancy's title because this is not the same game anymore. I don't think the game is going to back to the old direction so probably I will quit completely in the next season, as more and more people do this.\nThis video is explains everything: \nIf Ubisoft read or see this, please do something..."},

Indeed, however I say Siege in it's current state is a generic arcade hero shooter with MOBA atmosphere, character desing & \"\"\"lore\"\"\" with the stadium tumlbr tier fan fic stuff. Basically a weird mix between CSGO & Overwatch and some generic MOBA, but with few \"unique\" gimmicks like partial map destruction & the CTU's names, that's it. play it solo and it's actually a good game. it's when you play multiplayer, you see all the garbage stuff.I too liked ghost recon (yeah \"liked\") wildlands was decentish but what they did with breakpoint was super lame. online only + loot + sci-fi drones, i don't care about all the so called improvements they made. i'm still pissed about it not having true solo offline play.I was very happy when ubishaft saw the light and added offline play to siege, it suddenly had replay value. (and when i found r6modding i completely forgot about ghost recon)well till you mentioned it...if you haven't heard there's a tool a modder made called the r6 siege liberator which makes custom lan games less boring. providing you download preivous builds of the game (steam only) as it only supports vanilla through to y4s4. so you can play all the original maps and even the event maps in lan and you can play all the terrorist hunt modes solo as well as article 5 and the outbreak missions.i've downloaded every build so i can still replay all the previous content which is cool as the game used to be a lot harder solo with the enemies with the bomb vest. plus it's cool to compare the old and reworked maps. if they still included the original maps in the game that would cool but you can't have everything it seems."},

For example they removed the nights map completely and Zofia revive. Also they are making maps to maze, reworking for no reason. They made a new \"Logo\" to a game, I also recommend then removing the Tom clancy's title because this is not the same game anymore.

WHY? bad enough you can only have one shield per person per game even if the shield is destroyed! stop screwing with terrorist hunt and PVE mechanics! you cannot balance PVP and PVE the same! and stop forcing everyone to the broken multiplayer matchmaking! it sucks! I can sympathize with you in terms of the dilution of T-hunt experience via the removal of bombers and night maps in general. It's done for the sake of consistency to those who use t hunt to warm up for unranked/ranked matches. As for Zofie, her concussion rounds are not like flashes, I use them as a means to find out if there's people on site to avoid face-checking before entry. Her concussion rounds gives you an idea of enemies' presence when all your drones are shot. Zofie is more flexible than Ash but in PVP their gadgets are used to remove bulletproof gadgets (the melusi banshees, Evil eyes). Zofie has two types of rounds in her gadget whereas Ash only has breaching rounds( she's lost her fragging power with the removal of her flashbangs). Zofie's withstand's usefulness was always just 50/50 and this ability was removed/transferred to other ops at one point (Tachanka/Finka)... Zofie also has the Accupower (2.0x) with her AK, Ash doesn't have that on her R4C... so if you like flicking/ ADS/un-ADS Zofie offers that alternative to Ash. I don't see Zofie as a dumbed down Ash; her presence is super high in higher ranked matches. Shields wise... it was done because a lot of players found it difficult to make entry because of the shield meta, with guys leaning back and forth and Wamai magnets preventing the shields from being destroyed. It's been like that for a while which make it very difficult for the attackers. You have intel from Valkyrie cams and throwable denials from Jager and Wamai... You combine Goyo's shield and its area denial ability+ wamai it becomes a pretty powerful recipe.In short... I miss the old Siege's PVE experience as well, but I've since moved on to solo-q PVP since there's not much left in the T-hunt experience anymore... As for renown nerf; it has to do with guys using exploits and running afk scripts to grind renown... Some of those guys are hackers so they would use the renown to buy Ops and start cheating in PVP."},

Zofia is and will always be a better Ash because she's more useful with a better gadget.Tachanka is better now but still useless, just play Smoke.Nobody sits and grinds t hunt all day for 96 renown a game.

The problem you have is about imaging, which replicates to how accurate is the sound source is being played from (footsteps). My advice is to sell your 'gaming' headset and buy a decent set of headphones with a boom pro mic. To next level, combo dac/amp for sound fidelity.My recommendation about headphones: Phillips sph9500 if you live in a quiet environment because they're open back meaning you hear your surroundings. Or status audio CB 1 that are closed back meaning you don't hear much around you.Open back headphones have better imaging due to sound being able to move more freely. I hope it helps :)"},

{"r6": "Originally posted by UbiYubble:I'd love to get some more specific feedback on what everyone dislikes about the new method. Is it the lack of a Year pass, or that everything is in the Battle Pass? Well buying all the battle passes is more expensive than buying the year season pass, specially if you don't care about the cosmetics the battle pass has. 2nd the battle pass doesn't even returns it's full value in R6 credits, while the \"Battle Pass\" in games like CoD, Fortnite, Apex Legends, etc. does fully returns it's \"premium currency\" value once you complete the paid / premium track.3rd the battle pass generally is bloated with useless charms, as of now i'm sitting at 498 charms out of 525 charms, why should i want an even more bloated charm inventory when i barely use them? I only use the outbreak glowing charms (specially the apex one), the white mask charm & the old Operators Icon Charm Bundle, that have the \"original\" operators portrait icons back to the alpha & beta of the game.Aka this charm bundle:https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dDrXc97YOYs from the 1:14 min in the video up to around 3:50 min.Edit: 4th point was it really necesarry to extend the exclusivity period to 2 weeks instead of 1 week and to lock the new DLC operator there? Was the FOMO marketing tactic really needed to bump up the battle pass sales / profit?Edit 2: 5th point as @GameofThrows said, why remove all the benefits from the year season pass completely? The battle pass could be a tiny bit better if it had them, imho."},
{"r6": "The year pass had a lot of essentials for any user, especially the more casual player. It helped those who didn't have time to grind constantly. The people who are not interested in battlepasses are the ones that lose out the most by no year pass. You received for a reasonable charge the operators, a renown boost, 600 currency(if renewed), exclusive skins, a bonus to BP leveling, and most importantly a 10% discount on the store. The loss of the discount is huge, it incentivized buying more to get full value of the season pass. Sort of how Amazon Prime is only worth it if you order a lot from there because of the free delivery. So you have more stuff to grind for, and need to grind more to get whatever you do want. I won't even look at event or esports items anymore. Who knows if I'll bother with the new ops. The only real value is in universal weapon skins. I get it though, Ubisoft got flack from a lot of people by having both a year pass and a battlepass. I often heard from people that the bp should be included. So I get that it's a lose-lose situation for them. Maybe if they put the old bonuses into the battlepass it wouldn't be so bad. I have no interest in getting the bp, I wasn't able to finish the battlepasses I did get so I had to spend a lot to finish, and I don't even use most of those items. All for a hope of black ice, I'm sorry but it's not worth it."},

I'm not a coach, or probably even the best person at the game on the forums, but the devil's in the details, you're going to be using it on gadgets that ARE MEANT TO DIVERT YOUR FIELD OF VIEW IN THE FIRST PLACE such as:Deployable ShieldsBulletproof CamerasCastle's Armor PanelsMaestro's Evil EyesGoyo's Volc\u00e1n ShieldsMelusi's BansheesBe extremely careful if you're using it with an inexperienced/new team, flanks and rushes are deadly if the enemy team has information via a Valk, Echo, etc. That's all assuming you use it in the first place, I'd recommend just taking a Zofia and calling it a day, as someone usually loves taking carry operators with breaching gadgets anyways (Ash, Zofia, Maverick)"},

On top of that \"limited\" pro league sets are returning via twitch drops, for which we paid real money a couple of years back. These things are being marketed as exclusive \"one-time\" offers, meanwhile Ubisoft continues to rerelease them over and over again, it's like they don't care about their long time players. Buy what you find nice looking, exclusivity and the word \"limited\" means nothing at Ubisoft. Okay thanks for your explanation, I guess I'll just gonna buy Zofia Midnight first"},

{"r6": "Rainbow six siege. Aaaaaaaa. Where to begin. \nWell I do bloody love this game I wont lie, tense matches, crazy flicks, Destructive element, different tactics to attack/defend, the tension you feel in a 1v1 situation. Honestly there aren't many games out there that can make you feel great after a tight win or devastated after a close loss, in fact this game is probably the only one I recently have been sinking hours into. \nThen I got to platinum ranking online, it all changed........\nI grinded my way through a solo queue to get platinum and thought hey this is great I am not that good at this game but I managed to work as a team with randoms and win 9/10 of my games to be ranked at platinum, then I carried on for a little bit afterwards. Only to run into cheaters.......... cheaters everywhere.\nI mean I even played unranked matches and found guys who were rank 18 - 70/80 (which is not very high of course) stomping me and headshotting me before I even knew it. I understand there are people who smurf and just try to make people quit or annoy people, but when I watch kill cams the aim and the no recoil is insane. I mean one guy ran outside shot at me consistently from crazy range without his acog scope even flinching???! I mean surely nobody can control recoil that well from a far away distance it just does not make sense to me.\nHow has ubisoft let this game get so plagued with people who cheat? Someone even said 'Oh you never get cheaters in casual or unranked' Which I think is a lod of bo**ocks to be honest..... they are in unranked I know that for sure.\nAnyway the thing I am wondering is, does anybody else at platinum rank or higher seem to get this issue? even in unranked? Every other game seems to be a cheater it is absurd. I have never played a game where every other match there is someone either smurfing or cheating....... I am not sure ubisoft can do anything about it.... but if they can, they really, really need too.\nOh another thing.... before I get told to 'record the video evidence and send it to ubisoft' I really do not wanna spend all my time constantly recording things if it happens every other game....."},

It isn't a matter of skill to be honest since I get some kills in the game and actually win but the team still ops to start a kick vote every now and then (thankfully haven't gotten kicked yet) because you load a minute or two later than them. And I don't lag too when in matches.\nWill I expect this kick threat to happen more often at Ranked and actually succeed?"},

I have HDD, 7200RPM, nothing fancy, I'm always among the first ones to load into the game, if not the first. SSD doesn't solve all your problems (although it does make a difference) and HDD isn't the root of all your problems (or evil)."},

{"r6": "if they have a problem with you loading slowly they have a problem with their brain regards   :DDDDDDDD"},
{"r6": "Was also curious about this and without keeping track of the specific numbers i tried a couple of setups, using my main drive which is a Kingston M.2 SSD it takes a couple of seconds. ( most people online finish loading at the same time if not a couple of seconds later, so this is on par with most people ) Then i tried my D: drive which is a 7200RPM 1TB Drive, this one takes about 3-4 times longer and puts me in the position of people being wait upon with around 30sec to load. Out of all test matches there where still people loading slower than me and only 1 out of 10 times people tried to kick but it loaded before that time.Then i tried an 7200RPM external HDD on both USB2.0 and USB3.0 which didn't really matter as the results where pretty much the same, and which where terrible. Load times taking long enough to have longer conversations with people in chat than i usually have irl until you finally get kicked or if people wait the full almost 2 minutes while the other team is chanting to kick me.An SSD really makes the difference being around 10x faster with reading, buuuuuuuut using a 7200RPM drive still puts you in a position of around 30 sec load times which is still okay but using a external HDD with around 1 minute or longer is just not okay. Couldn't test one of those 5400RPM drives but i can imagine it would take around 30% longer.But about SSD's not being cheap, you can buy said hardware for around \u20ac30,-. Then again no one online can see your financials so the 30 euro could be allot for you. But if you have a spare drive slot, \u20ac30,- and don't mind using only one game on the SSD at a time this upgrade could be considered pretty cheap. (not even touching the subject second-hand hardware)TL;DR:Depends on the load times, if you make people wait for about 1 to 2 minutes every match it could be considered a nuisance to allot of people who just want to play. Although i pretty much never kick unless longer than 3 minutes, kicking someone and being short of a person thus potentially losing the complete game if no one else joins takes longer than the load times of the slower system."},

Ah now imagine that person coming late from work that's holding everyone up from the meeting but you're a key employee (so technically your position is something of importance and can't be casually fired) in that meeting that'll prevent everyone from getting laid off because you were the deciding vote. Losing in a fight because you kicked someone out will probably take longer and with more frustrations rather than waiting for 30 seconds of your life. How long does each match take, and how bad is the feeling that your losing because the enemy has more numbers than you do. (Players sometimes don't get autofilled in matches for some odd reason. I highly doubt that it's because there is a lack of players in the game)30 seconds to a minute ain't much compared to 4 minutes of losing per round.I understand that some people can't waste 30 seconds to a minute of their life waiting for a guy to load, but I'm sure that people don't want to waste 4 minutes of their life losing in a match where they could be winning. Who doesn't like winning. I'm not saying that the player they'll kick out will be the mvp and is the greatest out there, I'm pretty sure tons of people are better than \"slow loaders\" but RB6 is a co-op based game where there's a semblance of teamwork that's required to win."},

I would rather have Smoke with Shotgun and SMG-11 in all situations if I want to anchor.His gadget is very situational.

{"r6": "Rainbow six siege. Aaaaaaaa. Where to begin. \nWell I do bloody love this game I wont lie, tense matches, crazy flicks, Destructive element, different tactics to attack/defend, the tension you feel in a 1v1 situation. Honestly there aren't many games out there that can make you feel great after a tight win or devastated after a close loss, in fact this game is probably the only one I recently have been sinking hours into. \nThen I got to platinum ranking online, it all changed........\nI grinded my way through a solo queue to get platinum and thought hey this is great I am not that good at this game but I managed to work as a team with randoms and win 9/10 of my games to be ranked at platinum, then I carried on for a little bit afterwards. Only to run into cheaters.......... cheaters everywhere.\nI mean I even played unranked matches and found guys who were rank 18 - 70/80 (which is not very high of course) stomping me and headshotting me before I even knew it. I understand there are people who smurf and just try to make people quit or annoy people, but when I watch kill cams the aim and the no recoil is insane. I mean one guy ran outside shot at me consistently from crazy range without his acog scope even flinching???! I mean surely nobody can control recoil that well from a far away distance it just does not make sense to me.\nHow has ubisoft let this game get so plagued with people who cheat? Someone even said 'Oh you never get cheaters in casual or unranked' Which I think is a lod of bo**ocks to be honest..... they are in unranked I know that for sure.\nAnyway the thing I am wondering is, does anybody else at platinum rank or higher seem to get this issue? even in unranked? Every other game seems to be a cheater it is absurd. I have never played a game where every other match there is someone either smurfing or cheating....... I am not sure ubisoft can do anything about it.... but if they can, they really, really need too.\nOh another thing.... before I get told to 'record the video evidence and send it to ubisoft' I really do not wanna spend all my time constantly recording things if it happens every other game....."},

I get that some are slower than others, but some get the job done well and load you in instantly.. yeah I think you get what I'm asking now.) Not sure to be honest, that's why I think it might be server issues and it doesn't really have that much to do with it being and HDD or SDD. But when I usually ask people in chat about it before a game starts, they always say it's because we don't own an SDD. That's why I asked in this thread if an SDD will really make a difference since some say here that it will and some said an HDD will just load 30 seconds slower. Never said players would never load but said that some would load slower.

Even  if you ran an SSD with constant writes it would likely last close to a decade before it ran out of writes.Also defragging ssd's is different from HDD defragging.Defraggin an HDD is about moving files closer together on the HD so that it spends less time to collect all the data it needs for a file.For SSD's its actually about moving files around on the ssd to make sure that the ssd doesn't over use a single address to much and burn it out before others.Windows automatically does this for you, and once a month is a good sit for it."},

It isn't a matter of skill to be honest since I get some kills in the game and actually win but the team still ops to start a kick vote every now and then (thankfully haven't gotten kicked yet) because you load a minute or two later than them. And I don't lag too when in matches.\nWill I expect this kick threat to happen more often at Ranked and actually succeed?"},

I have HDD, 7200RPM, nothing fancy, I'm always among the first ones to load into the game, if not the first. SSD doesn't solve all your problems (although it does make a difference) and HDD isn't the root of all your problems (or evil)."},

{"r6": "Was also curious about this and without keeping track of the specific numbers i tried a couple of setups, using my main drive which is a Kingston M.2 SSD it takes a couple of seconds. ( most people online finish loading at the same time if not a couple of seconds later, so this is on par with most people ) Then i tried my D: drive which is a 7200RPM 1TB Drive, this one takes about 3-4 times longer and puts me in the position of people being wait upon with around 30sec to load. Out of all test matches there where still people loading slower than me and only 1 out of 10 times people tried to kick but it loaded before that time.Then i tried an 7200RPM external HDD on both USB2.0 and USB3.0 which didn't really matter as the results where pretty much the same, and which where terrible. Load times taking long enough to have longer conversations with people in chat than i usually have irl until you finally get kicked or if people wait the full almost 2 minutes while the other team is chanting to kick me.An SSD really makes the difference being around 10x faster with reading, buuuuuuuut using a 7200RPM drive still puts you in a position of around 30 sec load times which is still okay but using a external HDD with around 1 minute or longer is just not okay. Couldn't test one of those 5400RPM drives but i can imagine it would take around 30% longer.But about SSD's not being cheap, you can buy said hardware for around \u20ac30,-. Then again no one online can see your financials so the 30 euro could be allot for you. But if you have a spare drive slot, \u20ac30,- and don't mind using only one game on the SSD at a time this upgrade could be considered pretty cheap. (not even touching the subject second-hand hardware)TL;DR:Depends on the load times, if you make people wait for about 1 to 2 minutes every match it could be considered a nuisance to allot of people who just want to play. Although i pretty much never kick unless longer than 3 minutes, kicking someone and being short of a person thus potentially losing the complete game if no one else joins takes longer than the load times of the slower system."},

Ah now imagine that person coming late from work that's holding everyone up from the meeting but you're a key employee (so technically your position is something of importance and can't be casually fired) in that meeting that'll prevent everyone from getting laid off because you were the deciding vote. Losing in a fight because you kicked someone out will probably take longer and with more frustrations rather than waiting for 30 seconds of your life. How long does each match take, and how bad is the feeling that your losing because the enemy has more numbers than you do. (Players sometimes don't get autofilled in matches for some odd reason. I highly doubt that it's because there is a lack of players in the game)30 seconds to a minute ain't much compared to 4 minutes of losing per round.I understand that some people can't waste 30 seconds to a minute of their life waiting for a guy to load, but I'm sure that people don't want to waste 4 minutes of their life losing in a match where they could be winning. Who doesn't like winning. I'm not saying that the player they'll kick out will be the mvp and is the greatest out there, I'm pretty sure tons of people are better than \"slow loaders\" but RB6 is a co-op based game where there's a semblance of teamwork that's required to win."},

{"r6": "Rainbow six siege. Aaaaaaaa. Where to begin. \nWell I do bloody love this game I wont lie, tense matches, crazy flicks, Destructive element, different tactics to attack/defend, the tension you feel in a 1v1 situation. Honestly there aren't many games out there that can make you feel great after a tight win or devastated after a close loss, in fact this game is probably the only one I recently have been sinking hours into. \nThen I got to platinum ranking online, it all changed........\nI grinded my way through a solo queue to get platinum and thought hey this is great I am not that good at this game but I managed to work as a team with randoms and win 9/10 of my games to be ranked at platinum, then I carried on for a little bit afterwards. Only to run into cheaters.......... cheaters everywhere.\nI mean I even played unranked matches and found guys who were rank 18 - 70/80 (which is not very high of course) stomping me and headshotting me before I even knew it. I understand there are people who smurf and just try to make people quit or annoy people, but when I watch kill cams the aim and the no recoil is insane. I mean one guy ran outside shot at me consistently from crazy range without his acog scope even flinching???! I mean surely nobody can control recoil that well from a far away distance it just does not make sense to me.\nHow has ubisoft let this game get so plagued with people who cheat? Someone even said 'Oh you never get cheaters in casual or unranked' Which I think is a lod of bo**ocks to be honest..... they are in unranked I know that for sure.\nAnyway the thing I am wondering is, does anybody else at platinum rank or higher seem to get this issue? even in unranked? Every other game seems to be a cheater it is absurd. I have never played a game where every other match there is someone either smurfing or cheating....... I am not sure ubisoft can do anything about it.... but if they can, they really, really need too.\nOh another thing.... before I get told to 'record the video evidence and send it to ubisoft' I really do not wanna spend all my time constantly recording things if it happens every other game....."},

You will hear people say that it's less stressful on alts, but it's not less stressful for the opponents who have to face them. Casual and Unranked is such a feast or famine experience, it comes down to which smurfs really want to win in the most aggro way possible. I shouldn't have to drink a GFuel to play a casual, but sometimes it feels like that's what it takes. Until they add real active authentication, and not just something you do once and never have to do again and more importantly, make it worthwhile to play your main and not just until you speedrun your preferred rank and hop onto alts and play for stats. Until they stop having sales every other week and start looking at stats and identifying these as outliers and match them against each other, nothing will change.  The game needs a real casual mode, it needs a soloq, it needs to better servers to discourage aggro lean spamming exploiting peeker's advantage and actually rewards playing tactically.

Hmm, I've had similar experiences with Casual and Unranked, usually related to playing against the more hardcore audience like Plats, Diamonds and Champions. Casual and Unranked both have (and I believe now with the latest update, share) an mmr rating, although it's hidden. If you're playing unranked, and you use any sort of player tracker like \"R6 Tracker\" or \"R6 Tab\", take a look at who you're playing against, their rank, their mmr, their main operators, and try to get an understanding of who you're actually playing against, and if your own group's mmr is significantly lower than theirs on the Casual and Unranked playlists"},

Casual and Unranked is such a feast or famine experience, it comes down to which smurfs really want to win in the most aggro way possible.

Until they add real active authentication, and not just something you do once and never have to do again and more importantly, make it worthwhile to play your main and not just until you speedrun your preferred rank and hop onto alts and play for stats. Until they stop having sales every other week and start looking at stats and identifying these as outliers and match them against each other, nothing will change.

Each week let's say 4-8 random DLC operators will be \"free\" to try out for anyone that doesn't own them, during that time anyone can buy those operators with a 10% discount of their original price.However \"new\" operators won't be in that list, in this case Year 6 operators would be excluded from that list, however as soon year 7 launches all year 6 DLC operators would be put in the weekly rotation, alongside the other DLC's operators."},

I could record it with the highest tech software available, people would then say Siege's in-game replay system is \"broken\" and they're currently looking into it, but never pinning it on the hitreg.

I think it's also worth stating that I'm very used to the fire rate of Ying's LMG, I'm a Ying main with probably over 120 hours on her, I know exactly when each bullet's going to fire and where my crosshair's going to be, and some bullets should have absolutely never hit, or hit me.

{"r6": "I've invested 600 hours into this game, and I've had my fair share of ups and downs when it comes to playing Cas/Ranked.  However, even after six years of playing this game hoping that basic dissonance issues between what player see, the issue of hackers becoming more prevalent slowly but surely, and Ubisoft's unwillingness to add game modes and game tweaks the community has asked for unless a massive streamer begins requesting it has started to really ware on me.\n      I solo que often, and most of my teammates are truly unwilling to be cooperative in Ranked, let alone Casual.  Usually, most of them will make a terrible decision, putting their team at a severe disadvantage regarding man-count, and then they'll expect you to recover form their mistake or it's your fault.  \n     I ended up quitting siege for a year because of this, and now, after having been back for a few months and having started to progress in terms of skill (moving from Gold-III to Plat-III and low Plat-II elo) I find myself still running into these issues more so than before. \n     The rise of new bugs where my mic will shut off randomly, Z-pings (yellow-pings) sometimes not allowing you to place them, not placing, or not showing up on your teammates screen, and now teleporting players due to client side server issues (trust me I checked everything on my end because I desperately tried to fix it) have made Siege, a game about upmost precision and punishing difficult, less enjoyable and all the more punishing.  \n     This is supposed to be a game about precision, and yet it is and remains to be imprecise far more often than it should. While occasional issues would be understandable, it seems to happen every other match, and sometimes every match depending on the day.  I seriously appreciate this game, and I love it to death.  The devs deserve a lot of love for working so hard on it, but I truly am having a hard time enjoying it now that these issues have gone unresolved for so long.\n    Anyone else feel this way, or do I just need a new gaming chair?"},
{"r6": "I honestly can agree with you, I have 100+ hours in R6 so far, started playing within late February, this being my summary:Mic cuts off, sometimes doesn't even display that you are speaking.

(Casual is boring, Unranked is fun, Ranked can/can't (situational) be fun) For me I mainly Solo queue and I mainly find people who play casual/focused and have pretty much come across 2 trollers since I was ranked. Since only 1 IRL plays R6 it's hard to find a full dedicated, focused team but of course SQ will mostly prevent that.At the end of the day Ubi can fix this, it's tough work but sure they can put the work in (it's their jobs after all), and create more of a fun game with less/no bugs, new maps and use all available maps and a more funner environment."},

{"r6": "Originally posted by Zirpla:I honestly can agree with you, I have 100+ hours in R6 so far, started playing within late February, this being my summary:Mic cuts off, sometimes doesn't even display that you are speaking. (Since Crimson Heist Update I have had this problem)Pinging occasionally is delayed to like 1 second of when I press Z. (Since Crimson Heist)More New Game Modes. (Casual is boring, Unranked is fun, Ranked can/can't (situational) be fun) For me I mainly Solo queue and I mainly find people who play casual/focused and have pretty much come across 2 trollers since I was ranked. Since only 1 IRL plays R6 it's hard to find a full dedicated, focused team but of course SQ will mostly prevent that.At the end of the day Ubi can fix this, it's tough work but sure they can put the work in (it's their jobs after all), and create more of a fun game with less/no bugs, new maps and use all available maps and a more funner environment. I'm sorry to hear that man. :(  I was really hoping to be an outlier."},
{"r6": "Originally posted by TwisterCat:Absolutely feel the same way, been spending a lot of time on this game since Y2, and one of the main things that got me into the game is now driving me out, the community.Here's just some of my personal reasons for discontent from basic issues, to most objective failures on the dev team's part1. My teammates refuse to communicate2. My teammates play like it's casual, high risk, low reward bad plays, which I don't them flame for, but they do the next round anyways3. My inability to reach Plat without a competent team, despite being able to make impact kills consistently in any rank from Copper up to Plat 3-24. Poor hitreg, I've watched replays 100 times over, some hits were clearly not headshots5. Poor servers, players movement looks very stiff and slow, for a modern game. I've tried playing on 144 hz screens, there's no difference6. Smurfs, not so much an issue for me, but many people in the community have said it's very severe, and I'm constantly seeing accounts that don't add up for their level7. Increasing monetisation of a 6 year old game for no apparent reason other than money8. Lack of innovation by the new core devs, we're constantly given lame operators on a seasonal basis9.

Montagne's teammates are behind him, those teammates can shoot at the enemy while having moving cover (montagne) that is completely immune to hit teammate's bullets. So now the teammates do not have to worry about missing their shots and killing montagne, and montagne can now strafe without having to worry about being shot by his teammates. This removes and communication and teamwork between montagne and his teammates.If there is a caveria interrogating an attacker and they're on a destructible floor, or there is a destructible ceiling, attackers could just shoot through the floor and kill caveria without being careful with their shots. Having to be careful with your shots promotes being careful, or else you will also kill your teammate along with cav."},

{"r6": "Originally posted by cxrcle.:Originally posted by \u0389\u03a3X:What's the different's between casual mode, occasionally, ranked ?Are they just a same ? Casual has less rounds and less features. For example, Ranked has Map banning and Operator banning, alongside having more rounds, these don't exist in the casual mode. There is also an Unranked mode, which is exactly like Ranked, but it has no rank attached to it. Also the occasional thing I was saying are events, which are usually just fun limited time game modes and every season has a few of them. Yes and no. To me casual is superior over ranked and unranked.Casual has more maps, more game modes (bomb, hostage, secure area), no map banning (ubisoft should give in options option to block maps from matchmaking), no operator ban phase.Ranked and unranked have limited pool of maps, just one game mode: bomb, for less skilled players is available operator ban option to block for pending match operators which you are having problems dealing with, map ban phase because ubisoft refuses to give in settings option to configure maps we want to have in matchmaking. The only \"advantage\" of ranked is that you receive a rank which is based on meaningless in this game thing such as kdr and (this one is actually kinda important) win/lose ratio. Matchmaking is not different between casual and ranked/unranked, on this part they have exactly the same rules.Originally posted by \u0389\u03a3X:Originally posted by cxrcle.:Casual has less rounds and less features.

I guess you mean \"events\", which are usually randomly themed two week game modes with gameplay very different from what you usually play in rainbow six siege. Events also usually have dedicated map which is map custom made for particular event or modified to fit its theme. Events usually happen somewhere in beginning of new season which is every 3 months.You asked if siege is like csgo. I would say csgo looks like prototype build of rainbow six siege."},

Siege once had the concept of \"roles\" perfect, while still giving players massive freedom to play what they want, and usually people forgot roles were even a thing, but now the concept just feels dissolved and anybody can be anything, especially on attack. I seriously hope they fix some of these subtle balance issues with Season 3, but I don't know how they can without reworking the Gonne 6 and removing the Hard Breach"},

But the point is, it's not that they were powerful and they got brought down to the level the devs wanted, it's that we still have insanely overpowered operators and combo's which ruin the idea of nerfing ones like Glaz, Ela, Echo (not Cav, because she was \u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665 with that 1 tap pistol) and Kali. Another big issue is the addition of operators that completely overshadow other ones, like Ace outclassing Hibana, unless you like her gun that is, Zero having infinitely better guns than Twitch despite having equal abilities, etc. We need original ideas instead of whatever we're getting now, we need more threats available, not more buffs and counters to the ones already existing"},

For example, Ranked has Map banning and Operator banning, alongside having more rounds, these don't exist in the casual mode.

Also the occasional thing I was saying are events, which are usually just fun limited time game modes and every season has a few of them. Yes and no. To me casual is superior over ranked and unranked.Casual has more maps, more game modes (bomb, hostage, secure area), no map banning (ubisoft should give in options option to block maps from matchmaking), no operator ban phase.Ranked and unranked have limited pool of maps, just one game mode: bomb, for less skilled players is available operator ban option to block for pending match operators which you are having problems dealing with, map ban phase because ubisoft refuses to give in settings option to configure maps we want to have in matchmaking. The only \"advantage\" of ranked is that you receive a rank which is based on meaningless in this game thing such as kdr and (this one is actually kinda important) win/lose ratio. Matchmaking is not different between casual and ranked/unranked, on this part they have exactly the same rules.Originally posted by \u0389\u03a3X:Is occasionally mode appears everyday or months ?

This same applies to Clash, even if she is not banned, people do not pick her. jackal if hes not banned hes usually picked when you really really want the win and gotta get it, *personal experience :))*thatcherif theres a thermite/ace on idk,clubhouse and they will go cctv and hes not banned someone should pick him Thanks for this, so Thatcher is more of a map based thing while Jackal is more of a \"tryhard\" pick."},

Okay well first of all \"occasionally\" is not a mode, it's just a word i'm using to describe something that comes often. They are event modes (they have a name based on whatever the event is) and they come once every season, a season is usually 3 months long. On top of that, we have get arcade playlists which are basically just mini events."},

To me casual is superior over ranked and unranked.Casual has more maps, more game modes (bomb, hostage, secure area), no map banning (ubisoft should give in options option to block maps from matchmaking), no operator ban phase.Ranked and unranked have limited pool of maps, just one game mode: bomb, for less skilled players is available operator ban option to block for pending match operators which you are having problems dealing with, map ban phase because ubisoft refuses to give in settings option to configure maps we want to have in matchmaking. The only \"advantage\" of ranked is that you receive a rank which is based on meaningless in this game thing such as kdr and (this one is actually kinda important) win/lose ratio. Matchmaking is not different between casual and ranked/unranked, on this part they have exactly the same rules.Originally posted by \u0389\u03a3X:Originally posted by cxrcle.:Casual has less rounds and less features.

I guess you mean \"events\", which are usually randomly themed two week game modes with gameplay very different from what you usually play in rainbow six siege. Events also usually have dedicated map which is map custom made for particular event or modified to fit its theme. Events usually happen somewhere in beginning of new season which is every 3 months.You asked if siege is like csgo. I would say csgo looks like prototype build of rainbow six siege."},

Yes, there is a lot of concern. I agree with all of them, but im not worried. In high level play a team will stick with with whatever characters they picked regardless of enemy line up, this is because they will often have a set goal during drone phase. This change to me mostly assists in helping lower level players. As there is less communication and team synergy. I play mostly causal playlist, this change would mostly help in filling in the blanks for team mates who pick \"bad\" ops. Also in causal its impossible to predict where enemy site will spawn do to casual not allowing spawn choice for defense. Which means often I will pick an hard breacher for a sight that doesn't even need one. Plus Statistically R6 is defender favored, this change slightly moves the balance. In the end, its worth a shot for players to try out."},

My thought process is that I want to see more interesting picks, so I try to ban the more \"popular\" operators. Or that's what I aim for :p\nSadly... the usual bans I see are Jackal, Thatcher, Caveira and Clash.\nSo... as the title says, I'd like to know how others go about this. Just out of curiosity (if you want) I'd also like to know your rank if you commented. Personally I'm unranked but I'd say I'm around the Silver ranks. Have a good day Siege people!"},

Yes, there is a lot of concern. I agree with all of them, but im not worried. In high level play a team will stick with with whatever characters they picked regardless of enemy line up, this is because they will often have a set goal during drone phase. This change to me mostly assists in helping lower level players. As there is less communication and team synergy. I play mostly causal playlist, this change would mostly help in filling in the blanks for team mates who pick \"bad\" ops. Also in causal its impossible to predict where enemy site will spawn do to casual not allowing spawn choice for defense. Which means often I will pick an hard breacher for a sight that doesn't even need one. Plus Statistically R6 is defender favored, this change slightly moves the balance. In the end, its worth a shot for players to try out."},

I have played around 20 ranked matches and was Silver 1 at the start of neon dawn, 20 MMR away from gold 3, and have been on a massive losing streak. Admittedly, I am not the elite gamer and quite boomer but I know when this game has a problem; I've been playing since beta and have seen this game grow over time to the esports shooter it is now.\n I, a silver \u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665 1, played with my stack of friends with a few being relatively new to the game get matched with high elo players such as Gold 1s and Plat 3s. This was at the start of Neon Dawn which makes sense since the game is still deciding what skill group we should be playing with. Now, a few weeks in I am in Bronze 1 and I queue with friends in silver... and our opponents are all high clearance lvls (Idc if lvl doesnt mean skill, it still shows game knowledge and experience) and according to stat trackers are MOSTLY Ex-plats and Golds. WTf ubi. \nA game I literally played today was hopeless match against smurfs. My team, me, two new friends to the game, a lvl 109 and a lvl 53 (fresh of the \u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665 trees). The ENEMY gets a 4 stack of 3 golds plus 1 bronze, which they are BOOSTING as he did terrible in the game, and a lvl 300 that was ex-plat. Who the hell do you think will win. \nI would like to clarify that I have 5 years on this game and play for fun and with some competition and whilst I'm not as good as the elite I'm definitely not utter garbage at the game. So why the hell am I being forced to compete with obvious, self-admitting smurfs? I have evidently improved in the game, this season my K/D per game was around 0.9-1 for a silver player.\nI don't know what ubi uses to decide what match you are put in, but it is definitely oversimplified and does not take into account with game experience and anomalies in skill (beginners luck namely). \nI hope I'm not the only one dealing with this problem because it is making a game I once rooted for turn to an unenjoyable mess with ZERO competitive integrity."},

{"r6": "I think i've found why the MMR is really bad in casual & unranked! Each time you win a match you get +double digits (as in +10 to + 90) in mmr but each time you loss a match, you only get a minus one single digit MMR (as in -1 to -9).Exception being when the player under performs, aka K/D very close to zero, headshot ratio close to 0% and on top of that losing multiple matches in a row. If all those factors are taked into account the player starts lossing double digits in casual / unranked MMR.Basically, if you play with friends above your skill range or got lucky in SoloQ matchmaking, you may place in a hidden casual / unranked mmr way above your current skill lvl. And it's going to be a pain in the ass to lower the MMR by a legit way.The other exception would be, once you're in the 5000 + mmr in casual, then if you under perform you might loss 50+ mmr, specially when losing multiple matches in a row.My source is R6 tracker, looking at an ex pro league player (Pengu from G2 Esports) \"casual\" / \"unranked\" MMR. Also watching multiple average players casual / unranked MMR on R6 tracker too.https://r6.tracker.network/profile/pc/Pengu.G2/matches"},

{"r6": "Hitreg: a Community Issue"},
{"r6": "I've, since the lastest update, noticed a steep decline in Siege's hitreg capability. This is not new, there have been many people within this forum claiming the exact same thing, some operators supposedly worse than others. \nWithin this past week, I have noticed multiple instances where bullets that should have, or should not have hit, failing to produce the correct outcome. I have also noticed that the issue of hitting through bulletproof walls, a long-claimed issue of Siege, but never much actual footage posted onto the forums.\nIn these clips that I have recorded, I hope you can see where I'm coming from when I claim \"the hitreg in Siege doesn't work as well as it used to\", and this is what I frequently experience despite having a consistent 40 ping and good ISP, and usually the enemies I play against having around 40-60 ping also. \nIn this clip, you can see what I believe to be hitreg failing to register my hit, and actually doing damage, supposedly for a hit to the shoulder, which I believe to be false, although there could be some debate this is due to the sluggish nature of the Match Replay Beta, which could be possible, but I find it to be unlikely\nIn this clip, I find it to be less subtle, there's no question I am shot through the metal wall, and I was understandably frustrated. I have seen this before, it's not a new issue, I've done it to others, and others have done it to me. Due to the spark of the metal wall, I believe this was undoubtedly a serverside issue, not a local one.\nIf for any reason a moderator should need to remove one of these gifs due to the potential of cheats, feel free to edit the posts out of this thread, but I do not believe cheats were present in any of these clips, based both on the entirety of the match, and the consistency I see this issue.\nI encourage everyone to, before telling someone that their claims were due to lack of knowledge or them just generally being tilted of a fair death, to provide a clip of the incident to help enhance the legitimacy of this issue"},

At the end of the day, people will always find an excuse for why a complaint like this is illegitimate, even if it's absolutely unfounded or stretching the limits of possibility.

{"r6": "Originally posted by Lollash:You are playing on a potato, what did you expect? Do you have the game on a HDD as well? His PC is actually not bad. His card is still measuring up relatively nice to this day. His CPU  costs 3x more than his graphics card, and he has 16GB of RAM which is standard nowadays. As for the FPS drops, I would consider updating your drivers and updating windows if it needs it. Also I would turn down your graphics settings as it still looks very good on Low-Medium if you're ok with doing that.Edit : Just remembered, you can try using Vulkan too as that is another option. Vulkan improves compatibility with older hardware which may fix your issue."},

Is there any point in playing blitz if I could just go shield Fuse and have better results with his cluster bomb?"},

{"r6": "Blitz is alright, he has a few perks, like being incredibly dominant in small rooms and 1v1's, but the shield's hitbox makes him frustrating to use, and not really a valid choice for Ranked. If you like shields, I'd suggest you go with Monty Is there even any point in playing this game anymore? Why am I still here, just to suffer?"},
{"r6": "Blitz is either the most destructive attacker in the game or as useful as an AFK teammate. I use him quite a bit for fun in casual and sometimes I walk on point and manage to melee 3 people to death, othertimes I'll flash someone point blank and they'll proceed to spray blindly instantly headshotting me.To call him a mixed bag is an understatement."},
{"r6": "Originally posted by Corey:I'll flash someone point blank and they'll proceed to spray blindly instantly headshotting me.well managed quite few times taking out Blitz that way, problem is some think blinding someone equals a kill. most Blitz i encountered speed run once they blinded someone, giving no \u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665 about sprays nor the posibility getting meled. there is just two hights were a head supposed to be, standing and croching, so spraying a vertical line doesnt end rarly into a lucky headshot. but most mistakes from Blitz i saw were when they tried to mele too soon and end up either getting meled or a lucky strike headshot."},

Pretty much this though, the servers aren't really built for shield operators, and melee is just very underwhelming and unfair Ehhhh, the shield hitbox delay is pretty common for me.If you get shot and then move around the enemy can still shoot you for like 1 second.And ofcourse sometimes the enemy shoot your head and you just die, because a bug or bad visual feedback.As example, if you run then you cannot move your shield up and I think crouching has the same problem, but Im not sure, because I dont play Blitz that much anymore.Its more like that you kill the enemy in a dumb way or you die in a dumb way.So Blitz has nothing todo with skill, its more like praying to RNG Jesus."},

Some of this stems back to 'saving face' for your famiIy.  Better to Iie to save your famiIies reputation.  In western societies generaIIy if you are a cheater in game, for the most part, other pIayers hate that shish. As cheating and Iieing are not generaIIy acceptabIe.  2.) The comment referring to two Iikes on a Reddit post impIies your sampIe size, which cIearIy is Iacking and created a bias you are unaware of atm.  Your experience was true but is undervaIued as you are bIind.None of this is facetious and not meant to be condescending. And of course their are pIayers who do not cheat, and don't Iike it, but in generaI cheating is Iooked at as not a big deaI, and everyone knows mostIy its acceptabIe.

{"r6": "My general guide for games crashing in general:1. Download and install malwarebytes antimalware free edition and scan your pc with it.2. Go to control panel/programs and features, uninstall all programs you do not use.3. Remove files and folders from temp and prefetch folders in C:/Windows and C:/users/$username$/appdata/local and C:/users/$username$/appdata/roaming .4. Reboot your pc when you are done with these steps and try to launch the game.5. Update your gpu driver to latest available version. During installation select custom installation and use \"perform clean install\"/\"Restore factory settings\" option.If game still crashes then go to event viewer, windows logs/application. Find error log, copy its contents and paste in here.Game crashes usually are caused by software conflicts, like leftovers after uninstalled programs, conflicting overlays, bugged programs (recently msi gaming center was causing a lot of problems with games) or straight up driver bug. Rarely crashes are caused by games themselves, especially in case of siege i do not remember single confirmed crash caused by siege and i'm playing basically since its beginning."},

The topic of debate here is whether the pro's outweigh the con's, and I believe they do, as the issue of trolling and teamkilling is an entirely separate and more heated topic than leavers, they each need to be solved 1 at a time and I believe punishing leavers, if only slightly, would be worth it"},

{"r6": "Originally posted by UbiYubble:I'd love to get some more specific feedback on what everyone dislikes about the new method. Is it the lack of a Year pass, or that everything is in the Battle Pass? Hello there. The issue with the new method is that it is less value for more money. Previously we could get 8 ops for around $25, which also included uniforms and a pass exclusive skin and a vip bonus. Now We have to buy the ops individually for about $5 each. so that is 4 ops for about $20 without any of the season pass perks.Now I know we can buy ops through the battlepass, but understand that many wont or dont have time to complete the battle pass as there are many casual players. If the new ops will continue to be unlocked through the battle pass than the pass needs to be less grindy. The devs seem to under estimate how many hours it takes to level up the pass, its now more difficult without the 30% boost. The biggest issue is that the battlepass only gives progress for getting wins, i can lose 5 quick play games in a row and still not get a single level to my battle pass. I really hope the team considers to make the battle pass more progressive in the future."},

So i did it and after that i ran the game and ran into a lot of problems such as 'Failed to synchronize cloud saves' and when i finally entered the game it keeps loading and eventually says 'Connection to server error'. I reinstalled Siege and even reinstalled Steam and still ran into the same problems.

Is it the lack of a Year pass, or that everything is in the Battle Pass? Well buying all the battle passes is more expensive than buying the year season pass, specially if you don't care about the cosmetics the battle pass has. 2nd the battle pass doesn't even returns it's full value in R6 credits, while the \"Battle Pass\" in games like CoD, Fortnite, Apex Legends, etc. does fully returns it's \"premium currency\" value once you complete the paid / premium track.3rd the battle pass generally is bloated with useless charms, as of now i'm sitting at 498 charms out of 525 charms, why should i want an even more bloated charm inventory when i barely use them? I only use the outbreak glowing charms (specially the apex one), the white mask charm & the old Operators Icon Charm Bundle, that have the \"original\" operators portrait icons back to the alpha & beta of the game.Aka this charm bundle:https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dDrXc97YOYs from the 1:14 min in the video up to around 3:50 min.Edit: 4th point was it really necesarry to extend the exclusivity period to 2 weeks instead of 1 week and to lock the new DLC operator there? Was the FOMO marketing tactic really needed to bump up the battle pass sales / profit?Edit 2: 5th point as @GameofThrows said, why remove all the benefits from the year season pass completely? The battle pass could be a tiny bit better if it had them, imho."},
{"r6": "The year pass had a lot of essentials for any user, especially the more casual player. It helped those who didn't have time to grind constantly. The people who are not interested in battlepasses are the ones that lose out the most by no year pass. You received for a reasonable charge the operators, a renown boost, 600 currency(if renewed), exclusive skins, a bonus to BP leveling, and most importantly a 10% discount on the store. The loss of the discount is huge, it incentivized buying more to get full value of the season pass. Sort of how Amazon Prime is only worth it if you order a lot from there because of the free delivery. So you have more stuff to grind for, and need to grind more to get whatever you do want. I won't even look at event or esports items anymore. Who knows if I'll bother with the new ops. The only real value is in universal weapon skins. I get it though, Ubisoft got flack from a lot of people by having both a year pass and a battlepass. I often heard from people that the bp should be included. So I get that it's a lose-lose situation for them. Maybe if they put the old bonuses into the battlepass it wouldn't be so bad. I have no interest in getting the bp, I wasn't able to finish the battlepasses I did get so I had to spend a lot to finish, and I don't even use most of those items. All for a hope of black ice, I'm sorry but it's not worth it."},

Fair, it's certainly a possibility. The topic of debate here is whether the pro's outweigh the con's, and I believe they do, as the issue of trolling and teamkilling is an entirely separate and more heated topic than leavers, they each need to be solved 1 at a time and I believe punishing leavers, if only slightly, would be worth it"},

If you want to read what I actually said instead of jumping to conclusions than you might be able to redeem yourself.  Muting doesnt solve the problem of toxicity in the community.  It only solves it temporarily for you until the next person comes along.  I dont want to deal with these people in the first place, thus as I was saying I want Ubi to actually enforce bans.  That way these people have to shell out 20 bucks each ban which is a deterrent for kids on mommys credit card.  Yes it does work if the company actually does it.  I come from the WoW community.  Rarely do you deal with toxic people because Blizzard actually enforces its bans not to mention it costs like 50 bucks to get back on.By the way sure you might not be racist when you spout the n word, does that make it better?  Am I to assume that spouting a word that has such a history of hate behind it is fine?"},

This game was done years ago, I only play it couple rounds and even then I still encounter that crap.I actually think they should introduce 2v2 matches or such, grab somebody you know and have a go at it. Kinda like that wild west mode but on different maps. That might be a solution to all of us who don't have a full squad / going solo at it.

Nearly all the game I play they are just going for kills. Lost count the amount of times I have lost a game due to the fact that nobody played the objective properly. To be fair I play quickplay only.  I tried newcomers for a bit but that was actually harder than quickplay because everyone in newcomers were obviously not newcomers.  Anyways, people will play objectives if you tell them were things are.  I find that the games where i stay silent are the games people just go for kills and lose us games because they are in fact bad at getting said kills.  That is also why I always take defuser."},

My family is rather open minded too, I just do not like it when people, especially kids, use methods that have a lot of painful history associated with them to be \"cool\".

Learning curve is very steep more so than the vast majority of other games on the market and people are usually quite toxic. If you have a couple of buddies who play it and don't mind what I just said, go for it. Randoms are toxic A LOT and the matches are super unbalanced. But with a team it's fun. The hidden MMR system in unranked doesn't really work or it doesn't match up right. I have a hard time finding a ranked game. I usually spend a minimum of 5 mins, at least looking for a ranked game. Sometimes I can find one quickly, but that's rare. In my experience,  the past few months have been horrible. It's been super hard to find a quality match.If you have low expectations, then go for it."},

Well it changed the old folks from the Tom Clancy's & Rainbow Six franchise (the ones that helped the game emerge and gave money to the devs, so Ubi gave them more resources); for the generic arcade hero shooter with MOBA atmosphere & generic arcade fps with few unique gimmicks type of players; aka folks from CoD, BF, Overwatch, Rust, PUBG, Fortnite, etc. On top of that they attracted a few weeabos \"whales\" (aka people who spend an unhealthy amount of money into MTX's & gamble boxes, as if this was some sort of casino gambling addiction) & some of the SJW type of customers.In any case, you're right the game still has players and won't die from a technical standpoint & going by steam numbers alone. However the \"spirit\" and \"atmosphere\" related to the Tom Clancy's & Rainbow Six titles were murdered by Ubisoft a long time ago. Sometimes I still wish Ubisoft just removed Tom Clancy's & Rainbow Six franchise names from this game, and just give it a new IP and call it Siege: Champions of the Stadium / Arena or something like that.After all Siege atm is \"mainstream\" enough & in 2019 alone it gave Ubisoft 1 billion dollars in profit, wonder how much cash they've made with the battle pass shenanigans.

{"r6": "Alright first off, the gun nerf won't affect the pick rate at all, but most people probably know that anyway, even if jager had only ump or something as primary he'd still have 99% pick rate.\nNow the reason for this is simple and it's the gadget, he is one of the 3 utility denial ops and is without question the best one and as long as there's no alternative he will always have that high pickrate.\nNow there are multiple solutions to this, I'm gonna throw one such CONCEPT here and please for the love of god remember that this is a concept, it ain't perfect in any way but I'm just throwing ideas so we might get better ones\nMy suggestion is a complete rework, and making the current ads a secondary gadget that you only get one of. What this means if that a bunch of ops get the choice to bring a single ads AT THE COST of a nitro, shield, impacts etc. Jager could then maybe have a completely different gadget, (I was thinking of something like wamai but you have to place it down with an animation but as the trade off it won't get destroyed by flashes or smokes? I dunno obviously this is just a rando idea and someone could some up with something better)"},
{"r6": "the secondary ads idea sounds great, maybe his gadget could be that he could resist one frag grenade, still taking 25ish dmg, and then needing to replace his Steelplate or whatever, which he has 2 of or smth like that. smth armory like would be interesting for sure."},

We all do, the old core dev team was underrated, for all their disaster launches, fail seasons, and bad design choices, we all took their dedication to the game forgranted, they rarely took the easy way out, often designing operators which were hard counters, instead of adding some petty useless side gadget and taking away secondaries which were needed to keep a character useful. And designing TWO! Insane, I know, BUT TWO! OPERATORS IN A SEASON WITH A NEW MAP!!! To say I miss them is an understatement, you don't know what you had until you've lost it, and for all their flaws, they made the game what it is today.That's not to say I don't think the *publisher* Ubisoft didn't have anything to do with the game's current path, I know they do, but there's also no doubt in my mind we'd be receiving much, MUCH more content with the old devs, and my tirade on the forums probably never would have started many months ago, as I'd have just been content playing and enjoying the game I loved without feeling the need to give feedback or rant on the forums"},

I had a friend who I used to play with that was like that and didn't care to improve when I told him how, because he just wanted to get carried. If he actually wants to improve he can. I would give him a simple operator to play and work on one thing at a time, you need to simplify the game for him. If he plays Thermite or Thatcher or Rook, he has one task that you can direct him in. Don't let him play ops like Doc or Mira. Steer clear of operators that require vertical or map knowledge. Make a custom game if he wants to try out operators and see what they do. If he doesn't press Q or E, show him an angle to hold on objectives and keep doing that until it becomes second nature. Show him how to lean around corners when entering into a room or looking in a window. Even bad players can give good callouts if they take the time to learn rooms. He can explore with no fear in custom games and learn rooms/cams. Knowing the map will open up the game for him. Teach him how sound works and how to drone effectively, knowing where people are is half the battle. You can't expect him to learn all this at once though. He can probably learn by just watching you play. He lacks any kind of fundamentals so expecting him to win 1v1s isn't going to happen. There's a match replay in game now, he can see how people are killing him. Watch the match with him and tell him what he could do better next time(if you can, I don't know if you know him irl). If he's struggling with aim, make sure his dpi/sensitivity is not too high. Most new players try to flick everything. Everyone who has played this game has taken time to learn things, whether it's on youtube, twitch, thunt, reading or custom games."},

Secondly, this is more of a small rework, but a nice buff would be to allow her prismas to be deployed in different positions (standing, crouching, proning, etc) allowing the player to be more creative with the prismas. Yeah, that's a great idea, if they could sort out their technical issues, which fingers crossed, with their new core devs that seem to put a lot of favour into skins, maybe they'll work it out"},

The Ak-12, the F2, the C7E, the SMG-11, etc. are stronger DPS & very low TTK wise compared to Maestro LMG, I could argue he got the best defender weapon, stats wise (ignoring the Vector & SMG-11 among other high RoF & DPS weapons with extended barrel, for more long range DPS).The 2nd best LMG in the game atm is the G8A1, IQ's & Amaru LMG, as example with a DPS of 524, while maestro got 525 DPS with his LMG.Edit: SMG-11 got a DPS of 725, AK-12 got a DPS of 638; C7E got a DPS of 627; F2 got a DPS of 604; Ash R4-C got a DPS of 559; Zofia M762 got a DPS of 548, etc.Source: is Rogue 9 weapons spreadsheet, since it's the only one that got this big amount of data community wise.

Have you heard of Ghost Recon Phantoms / Online? It started as a class based F2P okaish PvP game with sci fi tech type of gadgets; then they added \"special\" magnum bullets you can buy for more dmg + RoF in your weapons, after that \"special\" kelvar and \"special\" helmets that made you much harder to kill you can buy; then gamble boxes, i mean loot boxes & \"special\" weapons you can buy with busted / broken stats to make the game easier; etc.Overtime they put even more P2W mechanics, until they made enough quick cash and shutdown the game servers. Their most recent attempt to pull a MTX's storefront with P2W mechanics & loot boxes, with a game as a \"side feature\" was Ghost Recon Breakpoint.Thankfully due massive negative feedback & spam everywhere Ubi removed most of the absurd P2W MTX's from that game. Yet the game flopped anyway due Ubi being slow to remove those P2W MTX's post launch.If Ubisoft want they can milk every cent out of this game via P2W mechanics & MTX's, then shutdown the servers and launch Siege 2 and repeat the process and turn it into another CoD annual release, type of quick \"cash cow\".

Tachanka's voice actor was changed \"due to unavoidable constraints\", i understand the corona the reason behind that. I feel like ubisoft  rushed this rework just to keep community quiet because constant flow of messages about \"WhEn TaChAnKa GeTs ReWoRkEd? Why i think like this?

Ash charges and Zofia grenades will just make a circular hole. All of the holes essentially are too small to actually cross or vault through. However, they do make good sightlines. Any hardbreach gadget will just... instantly destroy it. Essentially makes it so that Castle will pose more of a challenge. You either have to sink even more of your U T I L I T Y , one of your hardbreach gadgets, or try and find an alternate way through. Also you can make holes with the impacts.

Let the player be able to pick ammunition in the loadout like you would an accessory of the gun. Most notably the .45 ACP +P which would increase the RoF and damage at the cost of worse per shot recoil (which compounds with the faster RoF), and the .45 Super which is a supersonic +P. Though that said pretty much all US based agencies that use the UMP use the UMP-40, not the UMP-45. The difference basically being a lighter round with a higher velocity with a bit better total impact energy, basically being the lovechild of the .45 ACP and the 10mm Auto.This also opens the door for similar munition choices for other guns, most notably Shotguns which have different grades of shot and slug.

Can't you ask some of your teammates to help you make a small hole in the floor, example smoke or mute which often bring the shotgun + smg-11 combo or Castle due the UMP + pocket shotgun combo, etc?Also why waste the nitro cell in the floor, when you can break the floor with 1 or 2 mags of your pistol OR your primary smg. .....I haven\u2019t tried 2 mags of pistol on the floor but I\u2019m thinking the rubble is going to be in the way of all that pistol fire. So it\u2019s not enough to conceal the spider devices as Kaid conceals his electroclaws.Also asking a bunch a individuals who I\u2019d rather mute for screaming into the mic of unintelligible gibberish. Folks who give attitude ...and many obnoxious other individuals who I meet would be the least thing that comes to my mind. My teammates don\u2019t even want to use a microphone so ya their ain\u2019t nothing to improvise a tactic with teammates they just care for that ace and they do their own thing."},

I see, have you attempted using the Commando 9 (the other \"smg\" / carbine) mozzie has? It's good to make holes in a diagonal manner, kinda like how in 1 BOSG bullet you can open a hatch if lined up in a diagonal manner."},
{"r6": "https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2467591343From the 26 bullets it only took almost half magazine (14 bullets remaining as you can see in the screen capture) to open a hole in the floor, to hide mozzie spiders.Edit: So with the commando 9, at most it will take 2 magazines to hide the 3 mozzie gadgets.Edit 2: With the p10 roni it takes around around 14 bullets more of less.https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2467598483Edit 3: Seems like mozzie pistol is bugged and doesn't make holes in floors, which is weird."},

Doesn\u2019t make sense for mozzie not to have gonna-6 and it\u2019s idiotic to see that the nitrocell is used for rotation holes. If he needed rotation holes he should\u2019ve used a impact grenades instead of a nitrocell. Because once he uses a nitrocell to hatch or wall for rotation he\u2019s automatically weak against montagne. All the more reason why he should have the gonne-6.

Do not give me a Diamond carry and 4 coppers against a stack of golds for eg. that \u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665 is not balance not how a rank system should work.I dont know how to fix it but the whole system is \u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665 because its all over the place, rank is all over the place and the matchmaking doesnt even give a \u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665 about your rank all since it can put coppers with diamonds and all kinds of stupid \u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665 cause the elo numbers balance out ffs.

Mate, I think we're overextending this conversation. You're saying blitz is not balanced but at the same time plats and above don't pick him as much and he has a low win rate.... what ? If he's not balanced then shouldn't the pickrate/winrate be higher ? you know ? like jackal's ? Moving on, \"by my logic\" you can counter blitz by using any op. When did I ever say you need Warden to counter him ? Why would you throw by picking Warden. I clearly mentioned that he's loud so you know its blitz and you can be wary of him AND you can still knife him and shoot to kill him once he's close even if you're blinded. \"Jackal perma pinging\" was a metaphor. I know he can only use his ability 3 times, I thought you'd understand mate, are we in second grade or something ? Rounds don't last that long, if he uses his ability on you twice, that's more than enough pings for attackers to kill you or for him to kill you.

Originally posted by Clockwork Orange:Bottom line is wins and loss rate should not be adapted for quickly by the matchmaking, first and foremost the ranking system needs to just pick a rank for everyone that is a close guesstimate based off of their past performance.Once you have now placed them based off of this past performance start placing people as closely ranked as possible as much as possible to sort out any mistakes made in ranking you will see that a person who has been placed too low is winning by hard carry margins you can then make accurate calculations to increase their rank in order to place them properly.Over time it should become more and more apparent what rank everyone truly is provided that the matchmaking system has been placing opponents together that are as closely ranked as possible. Originally posted by Clockwork Orange:Next season rolls around peoples rank should not reset because then we have undone all that we have  tried to do in the first place, and that is to find every persons true rank and place them properly to pit them against peers that closely match their own abilities.

I agree to some degree. Some people will quote \"new maps and operators, ranks should be reset to see how people adapt to them\", but the new operators are few and maps are weak, and hardly affect gameplay due to lack of innovation. Personally, I think mmr should have a minor decay on a daily basis, and a large decay when the person hasn't played a game of ranked in over a week, and should not be reset at a new season. This would massively change how we view ranks, K/D, and W/L, and decrease toxicity towards stats and people hoarding ranks they don't deserve"},
{"r6": "Right now what we have isn't working, we all agree that matchmaking needs an overhaul, and the people that disagree are probably the Plat 1's and Diamonds with a 5-stack who burn nearly every team in their way. Solo-queue is hell, and ranks are illegitimate for people with a low K/D, creating a toxic environment of purely carry operators and no supports in Gold ranks. We need a consistent live-time ranked system that ranks people based on their CURRENT ability, not their past, and a separate solo/duo queue matchmaking playlist. Instead of working on stupid irrelevant changes, we need real change for Siege, things that will make a difference"},

Imagine this, You are hunkered in the back of the room 1 HP left and your buddy is up front in LOS of you but you can shoot over his shoulder to kill the incoming attacker, you will then have a tactical decision to make knowing that if you fire this shot you could easily kill yourself by hitting your friend and potentially losing the round.

What we have currently is a fanbase that feeds off telling people their ranks and making sure the world knows of it, and how good they are, there's no realistic way I can see them removing this, and plus, trackers exist for that reason.I believe the current ranked system will never be fully reworked, the devs clearly aren't showing any intention on it, so I go to the next best thing, a minor overhaul. I'd also like stats for W/L and K/D to only be within the past 14 days.It seems like a win-win, the fact we don't have any solution to the smurfing problem yet is absolutely disgraceful from Ubisoft Montreal, it's unacceptable, it's outrageous. There's many easy ways of going about this, be it closer to your ideas, or mine"},

The Twitch Prime all black skin for Zofia and the 2020 S.I. twitch final drop sledge skin. \nNow, since I got extra r6 credits to buy one elite skin, I don't want to invest it in an operator who I'm not comfortable to play with. However, I heard that Ubisoft plans to make the elite uniforms customizable, hope someone has heard a leak on the date or something.\nI prefer to keep my black-themed skins on use but I want to obtain their Elite Uniforms, too.\nSomeone help me with this dilemma lmao thanks."},

Instead of weighing the highest rank only, they decided to add rank restrictions. Once they added this change, boosting and partying with friends became harder, but it's still possible to boost thanks to #2.  2) The ability to party with unranked players in groups.

Then they hop on another account and continue the process.4) The unified ranking now means that Diamonds and plats can't go to other regions and pump up their stats, which means they need another account to protect their main when their party isn't on.  5) The adding of newcomer. Easy stat padding and easier wins.  6) The lowering of the speed of leveling in THunt. Since people can't level fast in thunt, they have to go through newcomer and casual, oh and they must win to level faster.7) This is the only one that isn't related to a Ubisoft change other than the terrible new Amazon servers makes exploiting peeker's advantage the only viable strategy, but just as important is Pressure to have a high kdr. Smurfing alleviates the pressure to perform since it's not your main anyway. If you've played Siege lately, it feels more like COD than even when dropshotting was a thing. Everyone plays only for kills. People are obsessed with numbers and not to get better, and the best way to get better numbers is playing worse players than you. In twitch chat and youtube, there's so many questions and videos about kdr and rank and getting better, it's like the self-help section in Barnes & Nobles. No one is playing for fun anymore. Smurfs are a good way to get the stats you can be proud of. 8) The endless sales. I might be missing some, but all of these factors work together to make numerous smurfs useful and not just having a single alt. It also explains why you see so many more around in casual and unranked, since they can't level as fast in thunt. We also should factor that high elo has a lot of cheating, which means a lot of people don't feel like playing at the level they belong and would rather protect their mains. Just hit diamond the first week or two, then coast on multiple alts.

Then about the squad up mechanics, what about anybody AREN'T able queue up for RANKED with any UNRANKED player, on top of that the mmr is based around the highest mmr player in the squad for both casual & unranked, and newcomer.Meaning if a champion / diamond / plat, wants to teach their newbie friends to play the game, they're going to play with people on the highest mmr of the aforementioned player.Then about newcomer & remaining smurfs, once the reputation system is here in theory it should put smurfs with other smurfs, griefers, cheaters, teamkillers, afk macro bots, etc. Thus eventually cleaning a bit the community overall, from the rotten apples.Also revert the Thunt nerfs in XP, reown, remove the XP & reown caps.

{"r6": "First time with the game huh? The game's toxicity has risen to just below that of League's, although there's still a pretty good gap between the two.If you're expecting to play a game without hearing \"ggez\", you'll need to be good, and being good comes with effort, time and knowledge, you're going to hear it alot when starting out. If you want a game with a pristine community, I recommend playing a niche game or server where the community is bellow 1000, 100 people, because this ain't it chief. I highly recommend you mute chat if you're new, you really don't need it, 95% of games nobody's going to be giving callouts in chat, or even voice chat, save yourself the sanity and just enjoy the game without any feedback, and if they teamkill you, just report it, leave, and find a better match"},

{"r6": "I dont think the matchmaking system works be cause of how the whole system works from the ground up.Someone who is in Champion should be known as a Champion to the system forever, they should not be placed in gold to try to re rank back up to their true rank, ffs the whole poing of a ranking system is to know who is what rank in terms of their ability.A gold player will forever be a gold player and should only ever play against gold players once the system knows that is their place in the ranks.If you happen to become better as a player you will perform better on an average over time and this should increase in rank slowly over time, people dont get that much better magically over night. here in lies the problem.The way the system seems to work now is people are all over the place gaining and losing rank on the constant and that is not how a rank should work, the game needs to assess everyones skill and permanently place them in that rank and only ever be matched against others in that same rank. Do not give me a Diamond carry and 4 coppers against a stack of golds for eg. that \u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665 is not balance not how a rank system should work.I dont know how to fix it but the whole system is \u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665 because its all over the place, rank is all over the place and the matchmaking doesnt even give a \u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665 about your rank all since it can put coppers with diamonds and all kinds of stupid \u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665 cause the elo numbers balance out ffs.

I was thinking what might have caused this surge in smurfing over the last year or two, and the main changes/factors they've made over the years that might be contributing seems to be the following:1) MMR restrictions in ranked Parties- Have low elo player in the party to lower the avg mmr of the group gives the high ranked players easier games. Instead of weighing the highest rank only, they decided to add rank restrictions. Once they added this change, boosting and partying with friends became harder, but it's still possible to boost thanks to #2.  2) The ability to party with unranked players in groups. The more alts you have the better, it's like having a NBA ringer in every Rec League or YMCA basketball game wearing a mask.   3) The ability to Match cancel games in conjuction with Overwulf, They use smurfs to take the fall to protect the mains if it's an unfavorable matchup. Then they hop on another account and continue the process.4) The unified ranking now means that Diamonds and plats can't go to other regions and pump up their stats, which means they need another account to protect their main when their party isn't on.  5) The adding of newcomer. Easy stat padding and easier wins.  6) The lowering of the speed of leveling in THunt. Since people can't level fast in thunt, they have to go through newcomer and casual, oh and they must win to level faster.7) This is the only one that isn't related to a Ubisoft change other than the terrible new Amazon servers makes exploiting peeker's advantage the only viable strategy, but just as important is Pressure to have a high kdr. Smurfing alleviates the pressure to perform since it's not your main anyway. If you've played Siege lately, it feels more like COD than even when dropshotting was a thing. Everyone plays only for kills. People are obsessed with numbers and not to get better, and the best way to get better numbers is playing worse players than you. In twitch chat and youtube, there's so many questions and videos about kdr and rank and getting better, it's like the self-help section in Barnes & Nobles. No one is playing for fun anymore. Smurfs are a good way to get the stats you can be proud of. 8) The endless sales. I might be missing some, but all of these factors work together to make numerous smurfs useful and not just having a single alt. It also explains why you see so many more around in casual and unranked, since they can't level as fast in thunt. We also should factor that high elo has a lot of cheating, which means a lot of people don't feel like playing at the level they belong and would rather protect their mains. Just hit diamond the first week or two, then coast on multiple alts. I think the most damning thing about all this, is that so many \"good\" changes Ubisoft has made were demanded and applauded by the community have caused this huge increase in smurfing, and honestly it's ruining the game."},

That's a fantastic input about the matter at hand, gentleman.So may I ask, a plausible solution would be to hide (client side & API side) the K/D stats and remove the K/D from the scoreboard? Then about the squad up mechanics, what about anybody AREN'T able queue up for RANKED with any UNRANKED player, on top of that the mmr is based around the highest mmr player in the squad for both casual & unranked, and newcomer.Meaning if a champion / diamond / plat, wants to teach their newbie friends to play the game, they're going to play with people on the highest mmr of the aforementioned player.Then about newcomer & remaining smurfs, once the reputation system is here in theory it should put smurfs with other smurfs, griefers, cheaters, teamkillers, afk macro bots, etc. Thus eventually cleaning a bit the community overall, from the rotten apples.Also revert the Thunt nerfs in XP, reown, remove the XP & reown caps.

{"r6": "I bought Siege because Rainbow Six Vegas 2 has the annoying gun loop bug when playing multiplayer. Me & my group of friends are only interested in playing T-Hunt. We just like running & gunning with each other. So, we are the 1% of players in the game, I understand that.However, with this new change/nerf to renown earning via T-Hunt it makes it impractical for us to unlock any of the new characters through normal gameplay.If I was interested in farming renown, I can now farm renown faster in solo mode by purposefully failing missions and re-trying.... (I can average 20-30 renown for quickly failing a mission vs the 70-90 for a successful mission)If you're AFK farming, do you really care how long it takes? Follow up question: How does AFK farming break any balance of the game? AFK farmers are basically paying their power utility provider instead of Ubisoft to earn characters within the game, and I guess that's an unacceptable loss of their revenue stream.Here I thought the Loot Boxes and skins is the method for monetizing PvP games. tldr; this update only punishes the legitimate players, those who are farming renown will still farm renown with their bots - it just takes a bit longer now."},

Aye fair enough, I do apologize for my rude demeanor. The thing is not everyone playing Thunt was an afk macro bot, some people were paying Ubisoft reown booster and found people to play a few hours to maximize reown gains, other people were merely playing to do silly stuff like double shotgun amaru / double shotgun jackal rush for the lolz.Yes playing PvP can be more fun, you're right. But going by numbers alone it wasn't and still isn't an efficient way to get reown per minute faster. Specially if you want to buy some DLC's operators or cosmetics (since most of the good looking ones are a tad expensive 20k reown plus for a head gear and generally 50k plus for a complete bundle).In any case, nowadays due all the Thunt nerfs, the afk macro bots have started moving to PvP which is an issue Ubi could've avoided if they didn't nerf the Thunt reown in the 1st place OR if they could've tell Battle Eye to do something about the afk macro bots on Thunt.

{"r6": "Yes, I get it, Siege is a PvP game. However, that doesn't mean that we can't have a bit of fun.\nT-hunt has now been downgraded to a shooting gallery. A crappy one at that. \nInstead, I think the Terrorist AI should be reworked along with new enemy types and traps to help spice up the challenge. I would imagine this would be implemented along with an ACTUAL. \u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665. \nEnemies: \nAs of right now, the basic terrorists can crouch and walk. However, I feel that the terrorists don't have one thing that should be important in learning the game. Leaning. Terrorists should be able to lean from doorways. Maybe to check before they go into a room. It'll help the player to learn muscle memory as well as make the terrorists much harder.\nBombers should be brought back. They were threatening as they literally ran at you and exploded.  However there should be two new enemy types.\nHeavies - Enemies with a hilariously ridiculous amount of armor on. To the point where they take even less damage from body shots than bombers. It's almost necessary for you to shoot at the head. \nCam Scanners - they essentially sit in a corner of the room and makes it so that you can be... well.. detected with the cameras. This will basically make it so that any enemy nearby basically runs towards you if you're detected. This will force you to remember camera placement.\nTraps (Elimination/Defuse Exclusive obviously) \nTripwire - Basically acts as a kapkan trap. You walk through it, it explodes.  I'm guessing it'll be connected to a nitro cell or something. \nCaltrops - Barely seeable spike traps. Acts as a lesion trap but without the poison.\nBear Traps - Yeah... what ability do you think this is reflecting? Essentially, you walk into one, you instantly die. Unless if you're playing multiplayer T-hunt (somehow) in which case it'll act as a frost trap.\nConclusion:\nOf course, all of this will be customizable. You will have the option to turn all the enemies/traps off if you want to. Along with the typical difficulty modes we have. Also, as a side note, I would expect that you'd have access to all of the operators in this mode. \nAs for how they'll even implement this. I don't know. I'm not a programmer lol."},

I would add just 2 small Quality of life changes that i would love to see on Thunt:1st allow us to play as attackers & defenders in the same team vs the bots on all Thunt game modes, Ubi has done it before with Outbreak, so in theory it shouldn't be hard to implement.2nd introduce an endless wave game mode, where you gain reown per wave survived, however each 5 waves it's get harder (as in bots do more dmg per bullet, spam smokes & frags more often and got faster reaction time / aim lock). Each 10 waves you need to hold an area with a flare for a supply drop (ammo, refill primary and secondary gadgets, hp, reinforced walls, drones, etc). Bonus idea for that mode:If your team made it past round 35, you get 1 alpha pack (of blue quality in normal, purple in hard & legendary quality in realistic difficulty) per 15 rounds; if your team made it past round 50 you get 1 day reown booster per 25 rounds; If your team made it past wave 100 you get 200% extra reown at the end of the match, be it your team goes to the evac zone or dies holding their ground."},

{"r6": "Originally posted by TwisterCat:Originally posted by Acinonyx:map rework is happening in PvP as well... and not everybody is happy about it.... but they do that to balance out maps for current meta and current operators.... some maps were created long time ago, when only basic operators were in the game, so some maps are quite out-dated and unbalanced.... and yeah, i guess a lot of people don't like reworks, because it means you have to le-learn the map again.... bomber enemies were not a good idea anyway, or rooms full of C4s.... it was confusing, especially for beginners, who were lost in PvP....and i'm sorry, but i don't understand why there are people, who pay 10-60\u20ac for a PvP game, and then they cry on forum, that they are not PvE focused.... there are plenty of PvE games you can play instead... stop trying to change PvP game into PvE....and for people, who would argue, that this is the best game, because of gun play or operators or something.... wait few months for Quarantine or whatever will Ubi call that PvE clone of R6 Outbreak.... and then wait for PvP people from Siege to come to Quarantine's forum and cry there about how they should make a PvP game out of it instead...

Sorry i don't see how changing a side activity to a bad training mode when people are asking for shooting ranges to train recoil with more ammo that can fast change ops and explosives better than terrorist hunt could ever provide, also guns have effects on terrorist hunt such as LMGs can break walls better and open hatches on terrorist hunt and not on PVP game mode so people will be learning slighty different things that will not work on the normal game.https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEcMJHOXv60They could have made a NEW training mode, but instead they screwed people who played terrorist hun, not sure why you are denying thisOriginally posted by Acinonyx:  CS:GO is also a service, and they are balancing and reworking...and no one is complaining there.....  https://steamcommunity.com/app/730/discussions/Dunno about you but i see a lot of complaints, and they did some horrible screw ups such as the R8 revolver actually, you're the only one, who mention shooting range in every discussion.... no one else... and as i mentioned in some of my other replies, i am not against T-Hunt overhaul/rework.... but this discussion/topic is about nerfing renown for T-Hunt....regarding shooting range to train recoil....there's this collaboration with Aim Lab, and you can practice recoil in T-Hunt/custom game anyway....for the possible issues with \"new\" training mode you're asking, just check my other post here, it can easily break the game, so maybe that's the reason why they didn't do it already...and regarding CS:GO, well, you have to understand it's 2021 and people are complaining a lot, for every little thing.... doesn't even have to be a big thing..... heck, all you need is one troll with clickbait topic.....so i would not refer to it like \"i see a lot of complaints in steam discussions\"... with revolver, i was playing CS:GO back then, so i know that was kinda serious thing.... but they just added new weapon, and they probably needed bigger audience to balance it out, which they did, eventually.... revolvers were quite often when they came out, they were popular, and too strong.... play CS:GO now, and you won't even know that some revolver is in the game, as only small percentage of people is using it.... but mistakes can happen, and they will.... that's why there is a team who is working on it, fixing stuff, balancing it... nothing wrong with it, if they are able to fix it...."},

{"r6": "Yes, I get it, Siege is a PvP game. However, that doesn't mean that we can't have a bit of fun.\nT-hunt has now been downgraded to a shooting gallery. A crappy one at that. \nInstead, I think the Terrorist AI should be reworked along with new enemy types and traps to help spice up the challenge. I would imagine this would be implemented along with an ACTUAL. \u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665. \nEnemies: \nAs of right now, the basic terrorists can crouch and walk. However, I feel that the terrorists don't have one thing that should be important in learning the game. Leaning. Terrorists should be able to lean from doorways. Maybe to check before they go into a room. It'll help the player to learn muscle memory as well as make the terrorists much harder.\nBombers should be brought back. They were threatening as they literally ran at you and exploded.  However there should be two new enemy types.\nHeavies - Enemies with a hilariously ridiculous amount of armor on. To the point where they take even less damage from body shots than bombers. It's almost necessary for you to shoot at the head. \nCam Scanners - they essentially sit in a corner of the room and makes it so that you can be... well.. detected with the cameras. This will basically make it so that any enemy nearby basically runs towards you if you're detected. This will force you to remember camera placement.\nTraps (Elimination/Defuse Exclusive obviously) \nTripwire - Basically acts as a kapkan trap. You walk through it, it explodes.  I'm guessing it'll be connected to a nitro cell or something. \nCaltrops - Barely seeable spike traps. Acts as a lesion trap but without the poison.\nBear Traps - Yeah... what ability do you think this is reflecting? Essentially, you walk into one, you instantly die. Unless if you're playing multiplayer T-hunt (somehow) in which case it'll act as a frost trap.\nConclusion:\nOf course, all of this will be customizable. You will have the option to turn all the enemies/traps off if you want to. Along with the typical difficulty modes we have. Also, as a side note, I would expect that you'd have access to all of the operators in this mode. \nAs for how they'll even implement this. I don't know. I'm not a programmer lol."},

Another example would be Fortnite.About the \"tutorial\" when Ubi is going to modernize it? Even an old RTS like Age of Empires 2 have modernized their barebones old tutorial, with new \"the art of war\" tutorial.

I'm talking about a place where you can have still targets, moving targets, targets popping up in random locations, have infinite ammo, being able to switch to any gun in-game without having to restart, changing attachments in-game, and many more things.

Aye fair enough, I do apologize for my rude demeanor. The thing is not everyone playing Thunt was an afk macro bot, some people were paying Ubisoft reown booster and found people to play a few hours to maximize reown gains, other people were merely playing to do silly stuff like double shotgun amaru / double shotgun jackal rush for the lolz.Yes playing PvP can be more fun, you're right. But going by numbers alone it wasn't and still isn't an efficient way to get reown per minute faster. Specially if you want to buy some DLC's operators or cosmetics (since most of the good looking ones are a tad expensive 20k reown plus for a head gear and generally 50k plus for a complete bundle).In any case, nowadays due all the Thunt nerfs, the afk macro bots have started moving to PvP which is an issue Ubi could've avoided if they didn't nerf the Thunt reown in the 1st place OR if they could've tell Battle Eye to do something about the afk macro bots on Thunt.

Lol you basically did like how else is someone who enjoys PVE supposed to take \"go cry about it In the forums?\" I dunno know about you bub but it sounds pretty derogatory to me read my comment again, i am not offending people who likes to play PvE.... but if you enjoy playing PvE, then you can still enjoy it, it's still there.... if you're playing it for fun, because you like it, then you don't have a reason to cry on forums....but yeah, main goal of Siege is PvP, of course, it was promoted as PvP game since the first trailer, so i don't see much point of trying to make PvE from PvP game... you can still enjoy that part, but no need to trashtalk about Ubisoft, because they are not focusing on something that does not matter....and a tip for you, don't be offended by everything you see on internet, especially if it was not meant the way you took it... i even specified that i play PvE sometimes... but not to farm renown.... there should not be something like FARMING at all! it's just something you earn for playing the game, so you should focus on PLAYING part, renown will come with that.... you want more renown? play more, or pay for booster... everything else is just abusing the system...and what's the point to play the game you're not enjoying, but you play it anyway just to farm some in-game currency? what are you going to do with that? you can't sell it, you can't trade it.... you can buy operators and skins.... but why would you do that, if you don't want to play the game anyway?"},

{"r6": "How to make T-Hunt better."},
{"r6": "Yes, I get it, Siege is a PvP game. However, that doesn't mean that we can't have a bit of fun.\nT-hunt has now been downgraded to a shooting gallery. A crappy one at that. \nInstead, I think the Terrorist AI should be reworked along with new enemy types and traps to help spice up the challenge. I would imagine this would be implemented along with an ACTUAL. \u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665. \nEnemies: \nAs of right now, the basic terrorists can crouch and walk. However, I feel that the terrorists don't have one thing that should be important in learning the game. Leaning. Terrorists should be able to lean from doorways. Maybe to check before they go into a room. It'll help the player to learn muscle memory as well as make the terrorists much harder.\nBombers should be brought back. They were threatening as they literally ran at you and exploded.  However there should be two new enemy types.\nHeavies - Enemies with a hilariously ridiculous amount of armor on. To the point where they take even less damage from body shots than bombers. It's almost necessary for you to shoot at the head. \nCam Scanners - they essentially sit in a corner of the room and makes it so that you can be... well.. detected with the cameras. This will basically make it so that any enemy nearby basically runs towards you if you're detected. This will force you to remember camera placement.\nTraps (Elimination/Defuse Exclusive obviously) \nTripwire - Basically acts as a kapkan trap. You walk through it, it explodes.  I'm guessing it'll be connected to a nitro cell or something. \nCaltrops - Barely seeable spike traps. Acts as a lesion trap but without the poison.\nBear Traps - Yeah... what ability do you think this is reflecting? Essentially, you walk into one, you instantly die. Unless if you're playing multiplayer T-hunt (somehow) in which case it'll act as a frost trap.\nConclusion:\nOf course, all of this will be customizable. You will have the option to turn all the enemies/traps off if you want to. Along with the typical difficulty modes we have. Also, as a side note, I would expect that you'd have access to all of the operators in this mode. \nAs for how they'll even implement this. I don't know. I'm not a programmer lol."},

{"r6": "Love those concept ideas @OP. I would add just 2 small Quality of life changes that i would love to see on Thunt:1st allow us to play as attackers & defenders in the same team vs the bots on all Thunt game modes, Ubi has done it before with Outbreak, so in theory it shouldn't be hard to implement.2nd introduce an endless wave game mode, where you gain reown per wave survived, however each 5 waves it's get harder (as in bots do more dmg per bullet, spam smokes & frags more often and got faster reaction time / aim lock). Each 10 waves you need to hold an area with a flare for a supply drop (ammo, refill primary and secondary gadgets, hp, reinforced walls, drones, etc). Bonus idea for that mode:If your team made it past round 35, you get 1 alpha pack (of blue quality in normal, purple in hard & legendary quality in realistic difficulty) per 15 rounds; if your team made it past round 50 you get 1 day reown booster per 25 rounds; If your team made it past wave 100 you get 200% extra reown at the end of the match, be it your team goes to the evac zone or dies holding their ground."},

Same goes for night maps, same goes for the Thunt reown nerfs over the years, same goes for other features removed over the years, etc. With night maps though, at least they could claim 'game size' as the culprit, it's pretty odd they'd remove a mode that's not taking up any space by existing Indeed you're right about the night maps taking \"game size\". Still removing tactical realism & it's magazine cycling system is odd to say the least."},

{"r6": "...there is no anti-cheat. None, whatsoever.\nI mean anti-recoil and other obvious macros that should be easy to pick up aside, and are so commonplace most people don't even consider it cheating even though they should because they clearly are and grants a huge advantage, the over-the-top and obvious use of wallhacks and aimbots, cases where there's no controversy at all everyone even their own teammates knows this is what they're doing and they just lol at everyone in chat not even denying it themselves, if your anti-cheat can't even detect these cases then it's absolutely useless.\nSome of these guys they're high-levels and has gone undetected for ages, we've stalked a few of them and seen for ourselves that reporting doesn't speed thing up either they're still active weeks after and still racking up insane stats. \n@Ubisoft, this is a disgrace, absolutely inexcusable no matter how you flip it, battle-eye is rubbish, completely useless, and everyone (yourselves included I bet) knows this. In reality this game is a free-for-all in terms of cheating, as you have no functional counter-measures in place at all.\nYou speak in length of taking \"cheating seriously\", but everytime you make that claim it's an insult as it's clear for everyone with eyes in their sockets and a somewhat operational brain (at this point you don't even need be of normal capacity in that regard to register what's going on), that you don't. \nIn fact I'd go so far as to say, considering how easilly the ones you actually do ban, eventually after they've been at it for ages griefing your customers, can aquire new and cheap copies of your games, that the cheaters are your preferred customers.\nYour whole business model facilitates this cheatfest and profits from it, and huge companies such as yours usually know what they're doing so I'm not buying into the narrative of you simply being ignorant to what's going on at all and helpless to stop it.\nEither way, whether you're absolutely 100% clueless and incompetent or simply a mainfestation of everything wrong and rotten with the gaming industry these days, the result's the same: As of now this game is pretty much unenjoyable for legit gamers with every ounce of competiveness and fair play stripped from it.\nCongragtulations on that achievement.

{"r6": "I mean if you really want to want not just modify the hardware of the controller? I don't know hardware modifications but from my understanding with the right now how you can avoid anti-cheat by using certain methods that don't directly effect the game. The truth is the most scary cheating isn't the dumb cheaters but the smart ones.I'm going to be honest, in other games, (not multiplayer) I have a lot of experience cheating and if the game has some way to try to stop the player from cheating then you simply cheat another way by an external non touching game method.An example when I play smash bros I wear gloves because the results I've measure that little bit of cloth can help me press the button just a little bit faster when my opponent and I attack at the same time where now I'm given a slight advantage.Since I have ADD I use stimulants such as coffee or whenever I remember to pick up my meds I use those and I'm able to focus. Some people take other drugs in gaming competitions that made it where people would cheat that way before drugs were banned.Sure software cheats exists but people are going to find holes and or exploits but I don't blame the devs. Unless they're using mostly client to server side checking to see if someone is cheating you honestly won't find if someone is cheating or not let's face it.Hell if I'm honest again, I might've used aim assist like programs in the past that didn't directly interact with the game in order to bypass the anti-cheat and no I'm not a hacker, I'm a script kiddie, there's a difference.My point is the devs probably have a hard time solving one cheating issue let alone MULTIPLE unless they do kernal level anti-cheat systems I highly doubt you'll see cheating go away any time soon and I REALLY don't want to see kernal level anti cheat."},

There are certain maneuvers that are impossible while at the same time retaining recoil-control, that's why anti-recoil is such a massive advantage it allows you to move way more freely than someone who relies on their own skills, and then there are imperfections to recoil-compensation that occurs no matter how good you are and the absence of these imperfections over prolonged time too are very detectable.Yet this is something \"everyone\" does in this game, and gets away with.Originally posted by Captain Spanky T.

None, whatsoever.\nI mean anti-recoil and other obvious macros that should be easy to pick up aside, and are so commonplace most people don't even consider it cheating even though they should because they clearly are and grants a huge advantage, the over-the-top and obvious use of wallhacks and aimbots, cases where there's no controversy at all everyone even their own teammates knows this is what they're doing and they just lol at everyone in chat not even denying it themselves, if your anti-cheat can't even detect these cases then it's absolutely useless.\nSome of these guys they're high-levels and has gone undetected for ages, we've stalked a few of them and seen for ourselves that reporting doesn't speed thing up either they're still active weeks after and still racking up insane stats. \n@Ubisoft, this is a disgrace, absolutely inexcusable no matter how you flip it, battle-eye is rubbish, completely useless, and everyone (yourselves included I bet) knows this. In reality this game is a free-for-all in terms of cheating, as you have no functional counter-measures in place at all.\nYou speak in length of taking \"cheating seriously\", but everytime you make that claim it's an insult as it's clear for everyone with eyes in their sockets and a somewhat operational brain (at this point you don't even need be of normal capacity in that regard to register what's going on), that you don't. \nIn fact I'd go so far as to say, considering how easilly the ones you actually do ban, eventually after they've been at it for ages griefing your customers, can aquire new and cheap copies of your games, that the cheaters are your preferred customers.\nYour whole business model facilitates this cheatfest and profits from it, and huge companies such as yours usually know what they're doing so I'm not buying into the narrative of you simply being ignorant to what's going on at all and helpless to stop it.\nEither way, whether you're absolutely 100% clueless and incompetent or simply a mainfestation of everything wrong and rotten with the gaming industry these days, the result's the same: As of now this game is pretty much unenjoyable for legit gamers with every ounce of competiveness and fair play stripped from it.\nCongragtulations on that achievement.

Sheesh...Nah I'm not dumb, it's just that this game is so infested with cheaters at present, and they get to cheat for so long before being caught and to top it all they're just right back in again as it costs them practically nothing gettinga  new copy, that the only logical conclusion to draw here is that UBI's approach to dealing with this problem isn't dealing with anything at allIt exists only on paper, hence, in reality, this game has no properly functionable anti-cheat.Nah I disagree on the macros. There are certain maneuvers that are impossible while at the same time retaining recoil-control, that's why anti-recoil is such a massive advantage it allows you to move way more freely than someone who relies on their own skills, and then there are imperfections to recoil-compensation that occurs no matter how good you are and the absence of these imperfections over prolonged time too are very detectable.Yet this is something \"everyone\" does in this game, and gets away with.People like you wouldn't know an intelligent statement if it beat you to death with a baseball bat then \u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665 all over your ugly, useless corpse, which would actually in itself constitute an intelligent statement.ffs this world's coming to.

{"r6": "Originally posted by MrLupus:...there is no anti-cheat. None, whatsoever.I mean anti-recoil and other obvious macros that should be easy to pick up aside, and are so commonplace most people don't even consider it cheating even though they should because they clearly are and grants a huge advantage, the over-the-top and obvious use of wallhacks and aimbots, cases where there's no controversy at all everyone even their own teammates knows this is what they're doing and they just lol at everyone in chat not even denying it themselves, if your anti-cheat can't even detect these cases then it's absolutely useless.Some of these guys they're high-levels and has gone undetected for ages, we've stalked a few of them and seen for ourselves that reporting doesn't speed thing up either they're still active weeks after and still racking up insane stats. @Ubisoft, this is a disgrace, absolutely inexcusable no matter how you flip it, battle-eye is rubbish, completely useless, and everyone (yourselves included I bet) knows this. In reality this game is a free-for-all in terms of cheating, as you have no functional counter-measures in place at all.You speak in length of taking \"cheating seriously\", but everytime you make that claim it's an insult as it's clear for everyone with eyes in their sockets and a somewhat operational brain (at this point you don't even need be of normal capacity in that regard to register what's going on), that you don't. In fact I'd go so far as to say, considering how easilly the ones you actually do ban, eventually after they've been at it for ages griefing your customers, can aquire new and cheap copies of your games, that the cheaters are your preferred customers.Your whole business model facilitates this cheatfest and profits from it, and huge companies such as yours usually know what they're doing so I'm not buying into the narrative of you simply being ignorant to what's going on at all and helpless to stop it.Either way, whether you're absolutely 100% clueless and incompetent or simply a mainfestation of everything wrong and rotten with the gaming industry these days, the result's the same: As of now this game is pretty much unenjoyable for legit gamers with every ounce of competiveness and fair play stripped from it.Congragtulations on that achievement. It's what you wanted, so you should feel proud. spot on post and this really applies for most games. definitely all games running battle eye... funny to read the clowns replying with the \"mad cuz bad\" comments.."},

And you too! We should all three of us find a room, hook up and have gorgeous perfect little Einstein-babies, or whatever.Meh... All part of foruming. And I am bad, but I used to be good and for a long time too (until my brain decided I was too old to still be tryharding), I also watch proffessionals play quite often so I can spot with at least 75-85% certainty who's \"legit good\" and who's just faking it as I know what to look for and there are so many tells that gives them away even with an untrained eye.And this game... Even if I'm 75% off in spotting a cheater, which I find highly unlikely, it still qualifies as \"dominated by cheats\" because even that number is staggering (and yes I do count macrokiddies I know some think that's legit because of how common it is but I don't anti-recoil and crouch-lean spamming especially those in combo with eachother gives a huge advantage when it comes to freedom of movement and also severly messes up weapon-balance).And no I'm not a sore loser, I still have fun I've learnt to accept them as part of the natural habitat, and in fact have some laughs on their expense too baiting them in order to expose and such......so yeah... \u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665 everyone pretty much, who thinks this is okay or that battle-eye is even near good enough to qualify as a proper anti-cheat.

Again the anti cheat is doing its job or rather what its meant for but very poorly/bad and should've been already fixed/improved.The other thing is, why do some of you people(like you for example) always bring VAC bans when someone responds to your post? \"U got vac stfu\", like both of their vac bans are over 800 days old, I think they learned their lesson.Either way, the anti cheat is bad or rather terrible and thats why most people already left/are leaving the game, just like myself.

None, whatsoever.\"\"In reality this game is a free-for-all in terms of cheating, as you have no functional counter- measures in place at all.\"And now you're saying its bad: \"it's beyond ridiculous how bad this \"anti-cheat\" is\"---Which one is it then? non-existent or bad?I dont understand if you've even read what I wrote but ill do it again, it COULD BE/SHOULD BE better, which means that im not defending Battleeye.I've came back to R6 recently and I haven't played with/against a single cheater. Judging by this:   \"while at the same time two-three obvious cheaters are running rampant in the game I'm in, all lvl 50+.\" --- you're one of those players who die by their own mistake or get killed by a legit good player and then complain/blame it on anti cheat/call those players cheaters. You're not the first who did this and not the last who will. Either way replays exist now so it should be easier to spot one.So in conclusion, yes the anti cheat is bad but it still does its job AT LEAST. I disagree, I have seen multiple cheaters in a match before, and naturally, due to the smaller size of the NA West server, I can frequently see the same people twice in a match. They do get banned, I get a message thanking me for my report, so it's not like I'm just tilted over being outplayed, they are actually hacking. The problem is, it can takes weeks for these people to get banned, that is entirely unacceptable, the anti-cheat system is borderline non-existant for instant banning, it would seem most bans handed out are by hand, not by machine Yes I understand that, it happend to me as well a few times but still you need to consider how many people who are actually good get reported/accused just for playing good. Like even when I used to play and went try hard mode I got reported by so many people even though I dont use cheats. And just like in my recent post, I never mentioned or said that Battleeye is good, its bad and it should be improved, but at least its something unlike TF2 for example."},

A roamer with no kills is not a very good roamer, they should play site because they're entirely unequipped to play roamers in the first place, stick to casual and don't play ranked if you want to play a roamer and not get any kills I see what you mean here, i understand that flanking could sometimes be better, but the main job of a roamer is to waste time, not frag, if you ask the question of \"are roamers suppose to flank and get kills or waste time\" to a q&a platform(example:reddit), then the majority of the people will answer with wasting time, because trying to go for flanks usually means you have to go and flank them from where there would be less people and that usually means the longest route possible, which could make your team more vulnerable to attacks since there is one less person holding site, you could lose a teammate while you are going for a flank, even if you flank and get 1-2 kills and make your team the side with the advantage, how many times have you had a opposing team like this? This would only happen if the opponents are low elo or just bad, how many times in mid-high elo have you ever seen flanks not covered up by a claymore or an airjab, or even if they dont have both, there is usually a flank watcher or a flank drone, so flanking a mid to high elo team is a very hard task and you usually come back empty handed while leaving your team with one less teammate, if you say that low elo dont cover up flanks, yes they have more times where they dont cover up flanks but what will happen when this roamer gets into higher elo, you dont want to learn something that will only work against lower elo players. Now lets talk about wasting time, while you are wasting time you are usually holding easy flank points where if the opponents gets that position, you are at a very big disadvantage, or you are usually holding common entry points where you could get an easy kill of or get some damage on the opponent and you usually retreat so you dont risk dying, in the opponents mind, you might be still holding that position or you could be rotating back, but either way they would usually have to drone again (if they already droned before entering), which means you are wasting time, yes most of the times you try this you might even not hit them once and get damages, but as long as you dont die, and they have the fear of you possibly coming back or being in the next room, they will either have to rotate to another entry point or they will have to drone, these both options waste time, the round is only 3 minutes, and doing what i just said could waste 20-30 seconds of their time, which is %10-15 of the round time, this time could be a round winner where the opponents might only have 15 second left to plant with your team still trying to hold them of, which if you didnt waste time you it could of been 30-45 seconds instead, where the team could do something else than trying to plant, round time is precious on r6, attackers are trying to play against time while defenders are on the same team as time, the more time you waste is better for you, not them, in my opion there are way more situations where wasting time is better than flanking and getting kills in mid-high elo, obviously there is more to wasting time and roaming then what i said, so you should definently look at videos about it or read about it, but in my opion wasting time is better in the long run, and has a higher success rate compared to flanking and getting kills"},

{"r6": "Vigil is better in the long run, and he's easier to learn. Ela isn't bad, but she's difficult to use and I'd argue she doesn't work on all maps like Vigil does.The Scorpion EVO is notorious for being hard to use after the nerfs. Only the first 16 or so shots have normal recoil before the it becomes uncontrollable because it's vertical and horizontal, so you can't empty a clip or anything like that and expect to live. You have to be deliberate with each burst of shots.If you're mechanically gifted, then that's not going to be an issue for you. For the majority of us, it is though because if you miss even a little bit, you'll pay for it dearly. It's also more of a medium to short range weapon. The shotgun isn't bad either, but it's pretty cheesy and you're toast if they have a competent anti-roamer. It can be scary in close quarters, but that's about it.Where she really shrines is on confined maps with choke points like Oregon in ranked or Outback in casual. She really does have to play off her mines and use her speed. Maps like that really capitalize on her strengths and make it more likely for her to get a kill or two.It's really important to try to get a kill as a roamer too. You aren't a complete failure if you don't, but recognize that roamers offer nothing else for the team. On attack you can get away with a good gun and a smile. It's an entirely different story on defense where utility is the name of the game. If you don't provide the team with kills, then you aren't going to be able to make up for it elsewhere other than simply being another body on point.Vigil is good for beginners because he's got an excellent gun, but as you go against better opponents, you'll notice how much more they use their drones, and his gadget will be more useful."},

A rotation/peek hole passive with her robot arm punch that's unique to her. It also makes her a decent near-site roamer. Access to bulletproof camera which really rounds out her kit.Her gates are able to be enabled again if anyone shoots its eye even after she's dead. Sadly, most people seem to forget that.Melusi is a failed concept. I say this because she's an operator that either is incredibly powerful or laughably weak. She's been nerfed in other areas to justify her gadget, and then recent nerfs are now targeting the bulletproof aspect of her gadget. Ubisoft doesn't want to go back on bulletproof gadgets, so Melusi mains are stuck between a rock and a hard place which is a position I don't envy.I wouldn't recommend getting her until they see the errors in their ways and rework her. I don't think she's particularly strong right now either or necessary."},

The issues regarding these OPs is based around their GADGETS, not their weapons. Any skilled player will still manage to play these OPs fine, even with the weapon nerfs. Losing 5 bullets isn't the end of the world. Heck, Jackal even has an LMG-like SMG. It's still a one-shot headshot game. HOWEVER, I do agree that Jackal was in need of some nerf or even better some sort of rework, but jager has already recieved a redesign for his gadget. These weapon nerfs are not going to change the frustration they bring to the opposing team. Does anyone else think that the nerfs are in the wrong direction? If you don't agree, please do share why.

{"r6": "...there is no anti-cheat.

In reality this game is a free-for-all in terms of cheating, as you have no functional counter-measures in place at all.\nYou speak in length of taking \"cheating seriously\", but everytime you make that claim it's an insult as it's clear for everyone with eyes in their sockets and a somewhat operational brain (at this point you don't even need be of normal capacity in that regard to register what's going on), that you don't. \nIn fact I'd go so far as to say, considering how easilly the ones you actually do ban, eventually after they've been at it for ages griefing your customers, can aquire new and cheap copies of your games, that the cheaters are your preferred customers.\nYour whole business model facilitates this cheatfest and profits from it, and huge companies such as yours usually know what they're doing so I'm not buying into the narrative of you simply being ignorant to what's going on at all and helpless to stop it.\nEither way, whether you're absolutely 100% clueless and incompetent or simply a mainfestation of everything wrong and rotten with the gaming industry these days, the result's the same: As of now this game is pretty much unenjoyable for legit gamers with every ounce of competiveness and fair play stripped from it.\nCongragtulations on that achievement. It's what you wanted, so you should feel proud."},

{"r6": "I mean if you really want to want not just modify the hardware of the controller? I don't know hardware modifications but from my understanding with the right now how you can avoid anti-cheat by using certain methods that don't directly effect the game. The truth is the most scary cheating isn't the dumb cheaters but the smart ones.I'm going to be honest, in other games, (not multiplayer) I have a lot of experience cheating and if the game has some way to try to stop the player from cheating then you simply cheat another way by an external non touching game method.An example when I play smash bros I wear gloves because the results I've measure that little bit of cloth can help me press the button just a little bit faster when my opponent and I attack at the same time where now I'm given a slight advantage.Since I have ADD I use stimulants such as coffee or whenever I remember to pick up my meds I use those and I'm able to focus. Some people take other drugs in gaming competitions that made it where people would cheat that way before drugs were banned.Sure software cheats exists but people are going to find holes and or exploits but I don't blame the devs. Unless they're using mostly client to server side checking to see if someone is cheating you honestly won't find if someone is cheating or not let's face it.Hell if I'm honest again, I might've used aim assist like programs in the past that didn't directly interact with the game in order to bypass the anti-cheat and no I'm not a hacker, I'm a script kiddie, there's a difference.My point is the devs probably have a hard time solving one cheating issue let alone MULTIPLE unless they do kernal level anti-cheat systems I highly doubt you'll see cheating go away any time soon and I REALLY don't want to see kernal level anti cheat."},

There are certain maneuvers that are impossible while at the same time retaining recoil-control, that's why anti-recoil is such a massive advantage it allows you to move way more freely than someone who relies on their own skills, and then there are imperfections to recoil-compensation that occurs no matter how good you are and the absence of these imperfections over prolonged time too are very detectable.Yet this is something \"everyone\" does in this game, and gets away with.Originally posted by Captain Spanky T.

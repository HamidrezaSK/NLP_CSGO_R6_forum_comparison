Simply put, VAC detects when someone is cheating on a VAC-protected server (2). This works delayed to catch more cheaters, because otherwise one person could just use one singular account till he finds a way to bypass VAC and then spread it. With it being more unclear what triggered it, and in what time frame, results in more cheaters getting banned and keeps them on their toes.Of course, due to it being detection based, something has to actually take place before it can be actioned. To compensate for the limitations this brings (both being delayed and detection based), there is Overwatch which doesn't look so much at WHAT someone is cheating with, but IF someone is cheating and gets power to the community to get people banned by simply reporting and peer reviewing (Overwatch FAQ).So, what more is Valve doing to curb cheating? They've of course Prime, Trust Factor, and many other changes (for example: limits on gifting, and no big sales) that make it harder for recurring accounts to come back and cheat, all the while making it not too hard for new players to come and join the game - which is a careful and delicate balance, because without new blood a game is ultimately just going to die.They've also taken steps to reduce the ability to cheat, as very simply put the way cheats work is just reading the data that the server sends your client (PC) to make the game work (the positions of enemies) and acting on that. By limiting the amount of data send, or the data that is processed on the server, they've reduced wallhacks and so-called no-spread cheats.Besides the last (limiting cheats at it's core), ultimately thsoe are just reactionary methods, and they get you in an cat and mouse game with no end. Which brings me to another big step they took, called VACnet (4), which aims at looking at what the cheaters have in common , which is of course cheating and which has some very clear telltales. They are teaching computers to discern the differences of what is possible and thus detect the cheating itself, not the specific cheat used. -- Related article(s): - Why doesn't Valve simply ban cheaters their PC?

The real number is likely even bigger."}, {"csgo": "In-depth answer: So why do I feel it doesn't?Besides the social engineering taking (1) place by cheatmakers, there is also a lot of misinformation out there, or simple knowledge of the subject. Simply put, VAC detects when someone is cheating on a VAC-protected server (2). This works delayed to catch more cheaters, because otherwise one person could just use one singular account till he finds a way to bypass VAC and then spread it. With it being more unclear what triggered it, and in what time frame, results in more cheaters getting banned and keeps them on their toes.Of course, due to it being detection based, something has to actually take place before it can be actioned. To compensate for the limitations this brings (both being delayed and detection based), there is Overwatch which doesn't look so much at WHAT someone is cheating with, but IF someone is cheating and gets power to the community to get people banned by simply reporting and peer reviewing (Overwatch FAQ).So, what more is Valve doing to curb cheating? They've of course Prime, Trust Factor, and many other changes (for example: limits on gifting, and no big sales) that make it harder for recurring accounts to come back and cheat, all the while making it not too hard for new players to come and join the game - which is a careful and delicate balance, because without new blood a game is ultimately just going to die.They've also taken steps to reduce the ability to cheat, as very simply put the way cheats work is just reading the data that the server sends your client (PC) to make the game work (the positions of enemies) and acting on that. By limiting the amount of data send, or the data that is processed on the server, they've reduced wallhacks and so-called no-spread cheats.Besides the last (limiting cheats at it's core), ultimately thsoe are just reactionary methods, and they get you in an cat and mouse game with no end. Which brings me to another big step they took, called VACnet (4), which aims at looking at what the cheaters have in common , which is of course cheating and which has some very clear telltales. They are teaching computers to discern the differences of what is possible and thus detect the cheating itself, not the specific cheat used. -- Related article(s): - Why doesn't Valve simply ban cheaters their PC?

I have prime status already I think it was when they fix a bug that made the trust factor work like it should again, i have seen that the trust factor have been starting to be worst and i think they should just remove the trust factor complety and remake it \"If you've had bad matches recently, it may have been because Trust wasn't working right.

I have spent thousands of hours and dollars over the past two decades in some way, shape, or form involving Counter-Strike. What Valve did yesterday was the final nail in the CS:GO coffin for me. For the past year or so, the community has been very vocal about the main issue CS:GO has with its massive problems involving cheaters and hackers. At first years ago, only really find people toggling in higher ranks, not so much in the lower ranks. At the start of this year, something has dramatically changed. not sure what, but something definitely changed. I have a 15+ year Steam account, 100+ comments on my profile, over 300 Commendations, and yet, I started to see a lot of cheaters in my matches. Blatant cheaters, with no cares in the world about getting caught because they knew nothing would happen. Not just in MM, but lately in every other mode. Yep, saw spinbotters in Casuals, wallhacks in Deathmatches, and if you could believe it, hackers in Flying Scoutsman. Someone would kill me and my entire team with headshots only within 15 seconds flat to end the round. Needless to say, cheaters have now infested pretty much every mode in CS:GO and yet Valve has said or done nothing about this. They tweeted out that Trust Factor working as intended, claimed to have fixed it, but the same if not worse after the matter. With blatant cheaters running wild and dominating CS:GO for a while now, Valve on Monday did what has been common nature with this company. Instead of being transparent and at least giving us hope that look into things or that a fix is coming to VAC, they hit us with news that sent shockwaves across the playerbase. Not only did they remove an insanely popular and iconic map in Train to replace with a map nobody cares for in Ancient, they blindsided players with a new monthly subscription. For .99 cents a month, you can view your in-game stats from your Competitive and Wingman matches. it. all you get. Valve is literally charging its loyal and passionate playerbase a dollar a month to see stats find in any other game for free. Yeah, I know, 3rd party sites can easily pull this info up for you for free but guess what? It be long before Valve starts issuing cease and desist orders to these sites because they want to make sure the only way to get this specific player info is through them and their new monthly subscription program. worry, hit these 3rd party sites sooner than later, guaranteed. After thinking about all this and the terrible direction Valve is taking CS:GO in, done with this game. Until Valve announces something significantly being done about cheating or updates VAC to something better, not playing CS:GO anymore. done. uninstalled CS:GO and it will stay uninstalled until they fix this. not spending any more of my time, effort, or money on a game that is just not fun anymore. not doing this anymore for a gaming franchise loved for almost half my life that treats me like a fool because they refuse to do anything to fix the embarrassing state of the game with blatant cheaters. No, not spending a dollar to see my stats in Competitive or Wingman against cheaters and hackers, especially for Wingman, a mode that literally nobody plays. No, not going to play Ancient nonstop to pretend a good map when actually a terrible map in Competitive. No, not going to pretend that Trust Factor means anything because it really I have other friends that have accounts similar to mine that played with for decades that have all left this game once and for all. sad to see the state CS:GO is in. I never wanted it to be this way but it is what it is. I still love Steam and will simply play other games until Valve either fixes their current state of the game with cheaters or announce the next iteration of Counter-Strike. sure working on whatever is coming next after CS:GO for Counter-Strike and maybe have 128-tick servers, VAC 2.0, better graphics, and usher in the next era of one of the biggest FPS games of all-time. Until then, done with CS:GO. That last nail in the coffin that was dropped on Monday has sealed the casket for me and I be more relieved because that confirmed best to step away completely. There is no reason to continue wasting my time, money, or energy in CS:GO since apparent Valve care about gamers like me anymore."}, {"csgo": "Yep I feel the same my man"}, {"csgo": "I totally agree with you and therefore gave you 2 awards, you put out my thoughts perfectly in this text and cs:go won't survive for much longer if they don't do something about their anticheat.

I agree in that CS:GO won't survive for long with the insane amounts of cheating and now this .99 cents monthly subscription nonsense. Something needs to be done, it could also be they're doing this now because in a year or two, they'll be announcing the next new Counter-Strike that'll probably have everything we've been complaining for years now.

Do they play ancient scrimmage or comp? I didn't think so. Maps take time to iterate and playtest, and even the popular maps now had a phase where people thought they were complete hackers have always been a problem. Name any other popular multiplayer game that has been around for some time that doesn't have a cheater. Also, VAC bans occur in waves, so you'll have to wait a week or so before everything settles down. That's to be expected. The truth is, where I am (NA), the majority of players don't run into cheaters very often.Sorry about your struggles, but it's really annoying seeing people complaining so much after an update."}, {"csgo": "It's a pretty good update imo.

CS GO has been around for 9 years, and a lot has happened in that time. 4 years ago, the game was running on my laptop with i5 5200u processors and GeForce 920M graphics at a stable 100 frames per second, which is a good indicator for such a game. Then the updates began to come out, which completely destroyed all the optimization in the game. The game (with all optimizations) is played at a maximum frame rate of 50 frames per second. It really hurts! All the load for some reason falls on the processor, which warms up to 90-95 degrees at a maximum of 100. I looked through a bunch of tutorials, tried everything I could, but couldn't get a better result. On reddit, a topic was created dedicated to the cause of FPS drawdowns in CS GO: Example: when the maximum FPS is set through the command \"fps_max\" 120 frames per second on the map\" office \" there is a drawdown of 30-60 FPS when walking, smoke grenades, shooting... The average temperature of my processor in this case is around 90-95, which is very bad for a laptop. At the same time, the average temperature of the video card is 64 degrees. In other words, the entire load falls on the CPU (the game starts with the nvidia GPU). Laptop: -Notebook ASUS X554L -CPU - core i5 5200U 2.2 GHz -RAM - 8 Gb -Video - GeForce 920m 1Gb -Windows 8.1 x64 To somehow play, I have to use the startup parameter \"-nosrgb\" and play with \"fps_max 50\". In this case, the processor temperature reaches an average of 70-75 degrees, depending on the map. I also contacted steam support and was told that I have a high VAR in \"net_graph\". But no one knows how to reduce it. Dear developers, please tell me how you can optimize the game so that you can play with normal fps without strong CPU heating? Do you have any plans to optimize the game in the future? p.s. I would love to buy a new PC and have no problems with FPS, and I even saved 6 years of money to eventually buy a PC, BUT . p.s.s I believe that CS GO will only get better and"}, {"csgo": "Undervolt your cpu?

We started with that question, and have been experimenting with matching players using observed behaviors and attributes of their Steam account, including the overall amount of time they had spent playing CS:GO, how frequently they were reported for cheating, time spent playing other games on their Steam account, etc. We call this system Trust, and these factors considered together form a Trust Factor. The results of the experiment have been positive. In matches created using Trust Factor, most players ended up generating fewer reports regardless of their Prime status. We wanted to keep the best parts of Prime and ditch the parts that cause problems in the CS:GO community. Starting today, players will, by default, enter matchmaking using their Trust Factor rather than their Prime status in the short term. Players with Prime status can still choose to additionally restrict their matchmaking pool to other players with Prime Trust is always on. Trust Factor F.A.Q. Q: What are the factors used in the new Trust Factor matchmaking system? A: not providing the list of factors in the Trust Factor matchmaking system for a few reasons. We want players to have to worry about any particular action while playing CS:GO or other games on Steam. Additionally, because constantly updating the Trust Factor matchmaking system, any list of factors would become out of date very quickly. That being said, in general looking at your past experience in CS:GO and on Steam, to ensure the system is as accurate as possible. Q: Can I look at my personal Trust Factor? A: We plan to display your Trust Factor the goal is to provide a better matchmaking experience without you having to worry about optimizing anything. In fact, in most cases knowing your Trust Factor be very helpful try to match you with similar players, but like skill groups, the range of players on a server will vary depending on the time of day, your region, the maps queuing for, etc. Q: What can I do to improve my Trust Factor? A: All you need to do is be a positive member of the CS:GO and Steam community. still iterating on the Trust Factor model and adjusting the way various factors are combined, but we want to make sure that all you have to do to improve your matchmaking experience is continue to play CS:GO and other Steam games legitimately. The more you play, the more information the system has and the easier it will be for the system to determine who you should be matched with. Q: I used to have Prime Status. Does that improve my Trust Factor? A: Yes! Phone numbers and CS:GO Rank are among the factors used in the new Trust Factor matchmaking system. If you had Prime Status before, your Trust Factor will benefit from your phone and in-game experience. If you have not linked your CS:GO account with a phone number, you so will improve your matchmaking experience. Q: a new player, will I have a low Trust Factor? A: Not necessarily. Your Trust Factor is impacted by your experiences on Steam as well as CS:GO, so if been a positive member of the Steam Community in the past, likely enter CS:GO with a high Trust Factor. Q: How will you know if this system is better than the previous one? A: In addition to reading player feedback, been evaluating Prime by measuring the way players interact with each other. Objectively, we can tell that Prime is successful when players stick to their matches and report/kick each other a bit less (these tend to be good measures of a pleasant matchmaking experience). We plan to use the same approach to evaluate the Trust Factor system. Q: I suspect that I have a low Trust Factor because the quality of my matches is poor. What can I do about this? A: Send us an email at ( u can find the mail on cs go blog) with the subject Factor and include a description of your experience and your Steam ID. These reports will help us improve the system. Q: I suspect that my friend has a low Trust Factor because of the quality of my matches when, and only when, I party up with them. What can I do about this? A: Tell them to email us as recommended above. Be aware that when players are in a party, we use the lowest Trust Factor of any individual in the party for matchmaking purposes."}, {"csgo": "This post looks a bit outdated to me.

Thing is that VAC is good, probably one of the nicest anticheats out there, but only works in a delayed way. The thing that we need is a method for VAC to work in-game, a collab with VACnet so it bans the cheater in-game then the match gets cancelled. Demo gets sent to overwatch in that moment and suspicious player gets a global cooldown until demo is seen and proved to be cheating or not cheating.

Once Indian Mumbai servers came out, they complaining about the toxicity of Mumbai server and once again come to SEA servers.CSGO is no different.

Now multiply that on a huge scale of how many cheat, and there is your issue with this game. It is a massive waste of time for the players, the developers, the cost of the servers to keep them up for this type of and most especially Valve, because they're not interested in the long term investment of gaining and keeping the loyalty of their best / most played players on the platform.It gets to a point where this is about greed and investing money into an update to see stats and release new operations. If Valve took $2B of their $12B Net worth to fix the game and then continue to update it, it would be huge for them to gain further loyalty in the fanbase and keep people like me from paying ESEA to play on their servers, stop mass trading hundreds of dollars in fees on the steam market every month, and having absolutely zero will to spend $15.00 on a battlepass just so they can continue to ignore the issues.It's time Valve solves the cheating problem (at least within the US + maybe Canada) to start small. Wouldn't even take any money at all, really. I call it Prime+In order to play in this mode, you MUST have tax identification / SSN information on your Steam account (much like you need to already, when you utilize the market too much and they require it before selling any further items)This would create a pool of unique players that once banned, that's it. Their literal identify in real life is completely banned from playing in this map pool. And what if they take their parents identity just so they can play a video game again? Easy. Get the terms of service out there and make sure everyone is aware this is not allowed on the platform and you can be sued for it. Valve doesn't do to make an example of anyone, and this is where the massive amount of cheaters comes from. Is by making a new account, and just everyone with a $10 purchase.I'd gladly pay $20.00 a month for Valve to implement this \"Prime+\" I've been thinking of for quite some time now.

Ofc cheaters are a problem, but that does not change the fact you have no real right to get a refund after that much time you spend using their product. You \"feeling\" that they should give you your money back because of cheaters does not change that.

And why should they refund you money for (example cases/capsules) you opened and used as they were intended. Going even further how would that even work? Assuming you opened 50 RMR capsules and sold the stickers you got to buy something else (game/gift/anything). If you get a refund for money you spend in the game anybody could come after opening capsules and say \"it did not get item xy i want my money back\".

I've liked it a lot, although it was really CT sided.Anyway, Grind isn't a Casual map.. It's with no cover at all, and Mocha..

Ofc cheaters are a problem, but that does not change the fact you have no real right to get a refund after that much time you spend using their product. You \"feeling\" that they should give you your money back because of cheaters does not change that. Steam has a clear statement that says you can get a refund within 2 hours of playtime or 2 weeks after your purchase. And why should they refund you money for (example cases/capsules) you opened and used as they were intended. Going even further how would that even work? Assuming you opened 50 RMR capsules and sold the stickers you got to buy something else (game/gift/anything). If you get a refund for money you spend in the game anybody could come after opening capsules and say \"it did not get item xy i want my money back\".

For example \"case hardened\". If you get a very rare position that is 100% complete blue, it's worth over thousands.For float, it is a 15 decimal range of our skin condition to ensure none of our skins look the same. It's ranged from 0 (very clean) to 1 (very scarred). Plus 15 decimal places you can get values such as 0.574827146272841 for an average skin. If your StatTrak\u2122 Gut Knife | Safari Mesh's float is 0.50646, its in the range of battle scarred, so it's worth $50. If it's 0.140, it'd be minimum wear and worth $60. There is no need to check float values since the game item itself will tell you that it's Battle Scarred. Float values are used as in-depth checks for the best of the best.

If you want to spray like a little kid then play cod.In cs:go they have made more recoil to the weapons and the hitboxes are smaller too, which means you have to aim really carefully.

I cant believe that people have to resort to cheating to be competitive! So, to make everyone aware, there have been a few new hacks that I have personally encountered. 1. Name-Stealing Hack. For some reason, there was a player who would continually change names. The name would be copied from someone that was playing, and when kicked, would kick the ACTUAL player, not the hacker. This led to some serious issues regarding how to rid the map of this @$$hole. 2. Aim-bot. There is a new aim-bot, akin to the source aim-bot that allowed for auto headshots without the shaky cam that was a tell-tale sign of such hack being used. WTF! 3. Auto-fire w/instant reload. I was spectating a suspected hacker when I witnessed something strange, a Nova that fired ALL rounds from the mag in one go. This led to the instant death of the poor sap on the receiving end, then watched a complete mag renewal in the space of 1 round being inserted, to again watch all rounds fired AGAIN into another unsuspecting player. These are just a few of the hacks that I have personally observed so far, and hearing alot more from around the Steam Cafe in my town. Hopefully Steam can do something about this. Or maybe arm players with a better way to report those that abuse the system. Maybe a HUGE repercussion for those that do cheat and are caught, and a reward for the player that reported the cheater."}, {"csgo": "that sucks i just bought it thinking there wouldnt be any lol oh well i shall record"}, {"csgo": "Not new for a Counter-Strike game.

Sounds like your only option."}, {"csgo": "I have noticed, as a overwatcher, that people are doing many wrongs when dealing with cheaters ingame. I decided to write a guide how to deal with cheaters, and what not to do: 1: Cheater is on your team. Dont grief the cheater. First, you run into risk at getting a autoban for TK:ing, but also, if you get reported into overwatch, and you were \"The suspect\" shooting a spinbotter in spawn, I would have no problems with setting \"Evident beyond a resonable doubt\" on Griefing, giving you a 30 day ban. Dont also abandon the game or try to kick teammates or whatever to end the game quicker than its meant. Just pretend the cheater does not exist. Dont also try to block the cheater from walking ingame or do other stupid things with the cheater, or your team. Even if the cheater gives your team a too big advantage, dont try to work against this by trying to drop bomb into unreachable spaces and such stupid things. Pretend the cheater does not exist! Cheater hunting is not your business, unless you are in overwatch, and if you are in overwatch, then you ONLY do cheater hunting while inside the overwatch system! However, DO report the cheater *ONCE*. Dont report the whole team. 2: Cheater is on opposing team: Dont make your own team worser because its a cheater on opposing team. Dont stay in AFK or play around because its \"unplayable\" with a cheater onboard. Dont try to abandon the game, you will get a ban, and dont try to kick teammates or whatever. Instead, try to work against the cheater, work with your team, try to do tactics to get the cheater killed instead. For example, you could arrange with your team to have the whole team to throw a nade each on the spot where the cheater will come, and possibly kill the cheater. By being AFK in spawn, or making a jerk out of your own team because its a cheater on opposing team, you actually hinders overwatch people from making a good decision. If your'e making it too easy, then it will be difficult to judge \"is it cheat or is it just that opposing team is way too easy to defeat because they are jerking around?\". Thus, play the game normally. However, DO report the cheater *ONCE*. Dont report the whole team. I have as a overwatcher, seen multiple cases, where the cheater is a teammate to the \"The suspect\", often spinbotting and have really toxic hacks. When you report the whole team unneccessary, you are actually helping the cheater! Instead of the cheater getting into overwatch and getting banned, you put a innocent people into overwatch that will get \"Insufficent evidence\", letting the cheater free! You might think \"If you are on same team as a cheater, and dont kick the cheater and/or voting no when other are trying to kick the cheater, you are as guilty as the cheater.\" but that is not true. Each person plays for himself, and theres NO obligation on voting \"yes\" on kickvotes for cheaters. Actually, its a bad idea to kick a cheater because it hinders the overwatch system. Dont votekick the cheater. It makes things worse, because if you votekick the cheater early, the system will propably not get enough material to overwatch the cheater. If your teammate try to votekick the cheater, vote no, and tell the teammates (secretly, read later about this) that its better to not kick the cheater to collect enough overwatch material. I once met a case where \"The suspect\" was available for 2 rounds. There was some suspicious shots, but nothing that I could take as evidence beyond a resonable doubt. After that, the system fastforwarded through 6 straight rounds and in scoreboard I saw that the suspect was replaced with a bot, that was a good sign of that the cheater was votekicked. It could also be a abandon, but most times people return after disconnects. If you that played this game, would have let the person be, and not votekick him, I would have 6 more rounds to watch and propably catch him. Which is better? Have the cheater be in game for the whole game, and then get rid of the cheater permanently? Or have the cheater kicked from the current game, but live with the cheater in subsuquent games because he not getting banned? Only report when you are SURE there is a cheater. Dont report innocent people, this inflates the overwatch system with \"clean\" cases, thus wasting overwatcher's time that could be used to catch cheaters. Dont just report because he prefire you on a specific spot. Try to judge if he is a cheater. I know its hard to judge if he is a cheater while on opposing team, but one telltale sign is if he shoots you multiple times through different walls or different smokes, or do moves that are practically impossible. Dont also report smurfs because you think \"they are returning cheaters\". Make sure they cheat first before reporting them. Same goes for private profiles, dont report people just because they prefire you and have a private profile. Try to do a neutral resonable judge (like a overwatcher would do, even if you are on opposing team and its hard), before reporting. Reporting innocent people is same as calling the police and telling that your neightbour did steal things from you, when he didn't. It wastes cop's work that could be used with real cases. For the same reason as you should not votekick cheaters, dont also surrender games with a cheater inside and a bot on your team. If your teammates try to surrender, vote no. By surrendering, you are also hindering the overwatch system. Its much better to play the whole game (Yes, I understand that you dont like it, but its quick anyways with a cheater onboard), because then, the overwatch system can collect sufficent material to be able to give a good verdict. When you have catched a cheater, report him as fast as possible. Dont wait with reporting him: The moment you report him using the in-game report function, is used to generate evidence in Overwatch. By reporting him at a incorrect moment, you run the risk of overwatch system picking up evidence from periods when hacker has hacks turned off, thus giving a negative test result and no ban. Note that you can ONLY report to overwatch during a match, not after the match is finished. You cannot finish a match and then report during a rewatch, pressing report on a match rewatch will direct you to the steam profile report function, so if the match is finished, then its too late to report to overwatch, sorry. You can however report via the steam profile, but then it will be processed by Valve and not overwatch, see later. Don't use the report function on the steam profile unless you are unable to report him in-game. Eg, if you have ability to catch the cheater during the ongoing match, always use the in-game report function accessed by holding down tab, then activate mouse pointer using the provided instructions, and then right click on the cheater and select \"report\". Only use the steam profile report function if you don't have the possibility to use the in-game report function. However, do always report when you have found a cheater. The reason you should use the in-game report function in front of steam profile report function, is that the steam profile report function directs the report to Valve personell, and those will of course only prioritize more urgent reports. The in-game report function, however does direct the report to overwatchers and it exist more overwatchers, thus your report will have a much higher chance to be taken care of, and data from when the in-game report was done, will be used when generating the evidence. Dont use both, it causes unneccessary report pile-up at Valve personell when the reports are processed by overwatch anyways. Use one of them, either in-game report OR steam profile report, and always prioritize in-game report in front of steam profile report. NEVER EVER launch a cheat yourself to try to \"counter\" the cheater. For very obvious reasons. No, \"1 cheater + 4 normal vs 1 cheater + 4 normal = fair game\" is **NOT** a valid argument! Cheating yourself is same as breaking and entering and stealing items from a thief, which in most countries would get you in jail. Just play the game like its supposed to be played - EVEN with a cheater on the opposing team. Just pretend the cheater is nonexistent. Just pretend he don't cheat. ================================================ The best thing you can do, is reporting the cheaters and griefers. Make sure they cheat, and once that, you report him. When you are making sure there is cheater, you also make the overwatch system safer, because then since only reported cases are put through overwatch system, the \"you must have been reported\" is also an additional safety against innocent people getting banned. When you have reported, dont tell the cheater you have reported. However, do tell your teammates that you have reported, so they can report too. Multiple reports from different people increases the chance the cheater gets in overwatch. (Multiple reports from same person however only causes unneccessary report spam). Not telling the cheater about report prevents the cheater from turning off his hacks to hide them. This can be a little difficult if cheater is on same team as you, but you could always use Steam chat for secretly telling your teammates about this without telling the cheater. (shift + TAB) When you have reported ONE SINGLE REPORT, you are **DONE**. DONT do anything more. Dont try to end the game prematurely, just play normally like the cheater didnt exist! All matches are streamed, but delayed, in GOTV. You can ask a friend to watch you, live, via the GOTV function and then tell you via Steam message if the opponent cheats, thus you can report them via the in-game function. The GOTV is delayed AT LEAST 1 round, but most times, more, so GOTV cannot be used to cheat, so dont worry about using the GOTV function as a tool to catch/find cheaters. If you have a alt-account or a \"smurf\", you can launch this on a second computer to watch your own match \"live\" (I put \"live\" in citation marks because the system is delayed 1-2 rounds), thus catching any cheaters, especially wallhackers. Note that GOTV watchers CANNOT report using the in-game function, pressing report will direct them to the steam profile report function, so its better if they forward \"I found a cheater\" to you that is playing, using steam messages (you cannot as a player see what GOTV watchers are writing using the in-game chat, so use steam messages instead), and then you can report to overwatch."}, {"csgo": "This is why novawatch is GGUnless you're joking, which I seriously can't tell."}, {"csgo": "de_molished: Now I dont understand you?

That helped, thank you... However is there a way to make it so that my desktop stays at 3840x2160 and my CS game remains at 4:3 Stretched Windowed? Several things...first of all, why do you want your display stretched out to a 4x3 aspect ratio resolution if your monitor is 16x9 or 16x10? All you wil be doing is stretching the 4x3 image on the screen. You won't gain any field of view, you will not gain any advantage becasuse simply stretching the image on the monitor will not make the other player's hitboxes larger or smaller.Big querstion...is you monitor a square or a rectangle in shape? If it is mostly square shaped and not at all wide like a standard rectangle, then it is either going to use a 4:3 or a 4;5 aspect ratio.The other factor in this is that you may have to set up your computer to do what you want it to do.

Buy and sell casesBuy cases and sell them for more, but don't go to the steam community market and buy them instantly, first you need to make a buy order for a lower price to sell them for more for a profit. Cases like horizon, cs20, clutch, chroma 3, danger zone, spectrum 2, and many more are quite profitable. And there's no hurry in buying cases, it's ok if you put some buy orders for something like 0.3$ if the case is something like 0.10$.2. Flipping skinsThis requires much more effort, you need to check every single skin and choose wisely to make sure which skin you should buy, some skins may be cheap but they may be cheaper after a couple of days after you purchase them and that's what happened with me.3. TradingYou need to be smart in this case. Most of people are looking for profit while trading and most of them will ignore your offers if they are cheaper than theirs. Many people i know fell for scams for having no idea what they are doing, so you better watch some guides to know where to start from. If you have rare skins or that's popular like ak-47 redline or m4a4 asiimov are the best options to trade, some people would accept your trades even if your skins were lower in price.4. Playing csgoPlaying deathmatch can sometimes give you good drops, cases, graffitis and sometimes skins that's worth more than 5 dollars but the odds are as low as opening a knife, and from these drops you can sell them and make some $$$.5. Don't riskDon't open cases or buy expensive skins at the community market, first of all opening cases is 15% profitable, so the chance of losing the money you spent on keys are 85% percent but that's optional you can do what you like to. If you think buying expensive skins from steam community market and selling them for more is profitable then nope. Steam would take 5% and 10% would go to the game owner. For example, you bought a skin for 1$, you sell it for 1.15$ you get your 1$ back, but anything beyond 1.15$ is a profit, and the more expensive the skin you buy would be harder to get rid off and make a profit from, and lastly have some patience. :)Thanks for reading I hope I gave you something new and helpful, feel free to add me. :)"}, {"csgo": "I stop playing this game unless the cheating problem is fixed or my account trust factor score is revised.

Everyone knows how disappointing it is to enter a competitive game and identify a screaming hack and have to play the rest of the game knowing that you will lose, you lose yourself a little, you don't know if you will continue to play or not, it is frustrating. We also know that Valve's anti-fraud system is unable to ban all cheaters, yesterday from seven games I played two had hacks and each day gets worse. The idea of this is as follows: in a competitive match, players can - by vote - ask for an immediate end to the game if they conclude that there is a user using external assistance, the points of that match would be frozen and disregarded until analysis, demo of this game goes to Overwatch (same as today), if it is understood that the accused user was actually using assistance he is banned, otherwise the accusing team would lose all points in the game as if it had been lost. Example: if at the moment the game is interrupted the game is 6x4 for the accused team and the use of external assistance is not completed, the result will be 16x4, so the accusing team is limited to asking for the end of the game only when it has the certainty of the use of external assistance by a user of the opposing team, as he will know that he will lose the game if no cheating is identified. However, if the use of assistance is evident, the frozen points are disregarded and the accusing team is not harmed at any time. This completely discourages the use of auxiliaries, as users will not have the opportunity to use them indiscriminately, it is clear that there will still be many users who will be able to disguise their use, however, the amount will decrease dramatically. In today's system, you report and have to wait until the hack is identified and the game is canceled, but you have no visual confirmation that the points you lost while playing the hack have been recovered, with the proposed system that we have , we will make sure that the points are frozen until the case is analyzed. Now thinking about owerwatchs, I could have that drop box system, skins or stickers for demos as a way to encourage players to analyze more cases. I'm just a person who likes the game and is increasingly disappointed that I can't play it, nothing more. If you liked the idea, help me make some noise and in one of them reach those responsible for the game, who knows, maybe we can implement it.

If there is no link between the game mechanics and the FPS, there is no reason to have more frame computed than your monitor can handle other than reducing the risk of screen tearing (happens usually when the fps drops below the refresh rate)."}, {"csgo": "im new to the game and i want to know some tips and tricks"}, {"csgo": "In the map inferno when you are terrorist at your spawn, you can shoot the bell at the left wall.

What they didn't realized was, that so many people tought the same, that the chest price got pushed further up bc so many people tried to buy them. Big demand-->price goes up. It was pretty clear that the price was only a hype price bc at some point the case was so expensive, that it was cheaper to buy 100 stars and get 50 cases out of the stars. After the new case got introduced with the same gloves as the broken fang one, some people relized that it would be best to sell the cases now which lowered the price. big supply/low demand-->price goes down. Now the price began to sink rapid, and many people got scared and start to sell the cases which lowered the price even more and faster. Till the price will go up to a level like the shattered web it's going to take a long time. (there are currently 10x less shattered web cases on steam market than operation broken fang cases). So many people have invested in broken fang cases that it will take a long time till it gets a \"rare case\" and price goes up to the level it was before.I think the price it is now is pretty stable for the case.

Everyone knows how disappointing it is to enter a competitive game and identify a screaming hack and have to play the rest of the game knowing that you will lose, you lose yourself a little, you don't know if you will continue to play or not, it is frustrating. We also know that Valve's anti-fraud system is unable to ban all cheaters, yesterday from seven games I played two had hacks and each day gets worse. The idea of this is as follows: in a competitive match, players can - by vote - ask for an immediate end to the game if they conclude that there is a user using external assistance, the points of that match would be frozen and disregarded until analysis, demo of this game goes to Overwatch (same as today), if it is understood that the accused user was actually using assistance he is banned, otherwise the accusing team would lose all points in the game as if it had been lost. Example: if at the moment the game is interrupted the game is 6x4 for the accused team and the use of external assistance is not completed, the result will be 16x4, so the accusing team is limited to asking for the end of the game only when it has the certainty of the use of external assistance by a user of the opposing team, as he will know that he will lose the game if no cheating is identified. However, if the use of assistance is evident, the frozen points are disregarded and the accusing team is not harmed at any time. This completely discourages the use of auxiliaries, as users will not have the opportunity to use them indiscriminately, it is clear that there will still be many users who will be able to disguise their use, however, the amount will decrease dramatically. In today's system, you report and have to wait until the hack is identified and the game is canceled, but you have no visual confirmation that the points you lost while playing the hack have been recovered, with the proposed system that we have , we will make sure that the points are frozen until the case is analyzed. Now thinking about owerwatchs, I could have that drop box system, skins or stickers for demos as a way to encourage players to analyze more cases. I'm just a person who likes the game and is increasingly disappointed that I can't play it, nothing more. If you liked the idea, help me make some noise and in one of them reach those responsible for the game, who knows, maybe we can implement it.

That's why hostage maps were never a part of competitive CS and is just and only in valves matchmaking for few casual player who like it. K i will never play that god forgotten gamemode like hostage rescue , would be better if they could bring map vip extraction mode from 1.6 Yeah we some game modes and for the competitive scene the only mode which works and is attractive are bomb defusal maps. Hostage maps are unbalanced based by their nature (defending only one spot instead of 2 and in case the CTs get the hostage you can defend another place (CT spawn), so you not only defend one spot once, but have even two chances of defending one spot.ViP maps are fun for a casual driven game mode but not for competitve. T's also only have to defend one spot and CTs have one player without a primary and even when having a strong armor (like the one we have for the strike missions) a pistol isn't enough to balance that. Also map creator don't have experience with both of these game modes. And there isn't much motivation to gain that experience. So they stick with the already working game mode where they have experience.I don't say that VIP and Hostage maps are completely bad at all. They can make fun in a casual environment, not in competitive tho. So a special casual game mode with no ranks where you can play those modes would be cool.Originally posted by Wunderwaffe:Its not so hard, wait (and dont die) until Ts run out of utility, smoke mid and nade paper. Do some fakes at long so Ts waste utility there too so they dont save it all for mid. Even when there is time left before getting to the hostages after 5 mollies and 5 smokes were placed (and probably some negev spammer) it's still not a game mode you'd want. Literally standing there every single round for 1,5 minutes just to rush to the hostage in the last 15 seconds to hope that you get it isn't a game mode which is interesting nor working. On bomb defusal maps you've way more ways, open ways, you can go for entry fragging, can play slow aswell, can fake and more. Even on maps like inferno where banana and upper mid is also easily smoke- and molly-able you can still go through apps or pop flash through it, because there the further ways are wide open and you've room to work with.

Now that I've clarified that, I can begin. -CS:GO Cheats are everywhere A quick google search and you can easily find a working CS:GO cheat that isn't a Trojan or a Virus. And even if you don't trust that, with a little bit of experience in coding you can easily create a simple \"Wallhack\" for CS:GO. But even better is that you don't even need to code, a quick search on \"Github\" and you found yourself an entire CS:GO cheat that just needs a quick check in the code. And on top of aaaaalll that, VAC is literally soooo easy to bypass. Even a kid can do it. -\"Prime\" Prime is way too cheap. No, I do not mean the \"Prime Upgrade\" from the store, there is nothing wrong with that but what wrong is is \"Cheap Prime Accounts\". First of all selling these accounts is against the ToS of Steam. And 2nd is as I said the accounts are too cheap. For only you can get you're hands on a Prime account. Compare that with the Prime Upgrade from the steam store... Now you will be questioning: \"How can you get a Prime account for so cheap?\" It's simple: When you reach level 21 in the game you get a free Prime Status upgrade. And those peepoos invented something called: Vertigo Booster Panel. It works really simple. You input 10 accounts and the program automatically boosts them to lvl21 and boom, easy money for them, more cheaters for us. This same exact Panel also gets used to boost peoples ranks, but lets not get into that. That is basically my opinion on 2 big problems of CS:GO.
